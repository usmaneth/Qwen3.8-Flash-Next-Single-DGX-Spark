# Changelog

Notable changes to this deployment kit. The repository is not versioned; entries
are grouped by date, newest first. Every measurement named here was taken on the
one DGX Spark this repo is written for — treat them as that host's numbers, not
as promises.

## 2026-09-24

### Added

- **PLE row I/O module (`files/ple_io/`, knobs `VLLM_PLE_IO_*`).** The
  PLE offload worker now gets its rows through `ple_io.gather()`. The bytes
  still come from one `torch.index_select` over the mmap, so every mode
  gives the same rows. Two changes are on by default:
  - B1, `VLLM_PLE_IO_MODE=batch`: a gather of 4096 rows or more (a prefill
    chunk) sends one batched `process_madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)` over 8
    threads. A cold 131,072-row set took 43.8 ms, the fadvise loop 94.8 ms.
  - B2, `VLLM_PLE_IO_DEFER=1`: on eager steps the wait for the PLE rows
    moves from the connector to the layer that reads them. The GPU runs
    the embedding and layer 0 during the CPU gather. The GPU gap per cold
    8K chunk fell from 48.9 to 6.5 ms (r1) and from 53.3 to 10.5 ms (r2).
  Measured on spark1 (lease l2-20260924T152952, 2 interleaved pairs, cold
  page cache): TTFT 8K 4.17 to 4.06 s, 32K 16.85 to 16.47 s, 128K 71.96 to
  70.27 s (about -2.5%). Decode ms/step did not change (85.3/86.5 against
  85.9/86.1). Gates: CPU byte identity (real table), greedy output
  identity, GPU/CPU row digests 192/192 joined with 0 mismatches,
  nllgate.py unchanged. The worker RSS grows by about 4 MB (anonymous).
  Rollback: `VLLM_PLE_IO_MODE=fadvise` and `VLLM_PLE_IO_DEFER=0` in `.env`.
  Knobs and the defer safety rules are in README "PLE row I/O". Tests:
  `files/ple_io/test_ple_io.py`, `test_defer.py`, `test_fast.py`.

## 2026-09-23

### Added

- **Watchdog relief step for the MemFree floor (`MEMWATCH_RELIEF`).** With
  `drop_caches`, `files/memwatch.sh` drops clean page cache once before the
  MemFree floor stops the container, and stops only if MemFree stays low.
  Default `off` keeps the old behaviour line for line;
  `profiles/spark1-best.env` turns it on after the 2026-09-23 08:36 stop at
  MemFree 1.2 GiB with 5.7 GiB page cache still resident. Knobs, rate limit
  and failure fallback are in README "Watchdog". Hermetic tests:
  `tests/test_memwatch_relief.sh`.

## 2026-09-18

### Measured

- **The NVIDIA × `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8` reserve cell** (jvr0x's follow-up ask on PR
  #41): `TP1_MODEL_ID=nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4`, `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8`,
  `PLE_GIB=47.68`, `MTP_WEIGHTS_GIB=2.34`, `HOST_RESERVE_GIB=30` on the
  121.69 GiB host. Peak driver **98.3 GiB** against the 91.63 GiB budget —
  the same capture-spike overshoot #47 measured at width 4, absorbed by the
  reserve; MemFree floor **12.05 GiB** (never near the 2 GiB watchdog
  floor); **2 `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY`**, both at engine init before shard load
  (the README's "a handful during startup is normal" class), **0** through
  graph capture, serving and C4 benchmark bursts; KV pool **8.87 GiB =
  591,654 tokens** (2.26x at 262144); smoke 7/8 + the known GB10
  determinism WARN, vision passing on re-run. Verdict: **30 covers both
  bumps**; the `.env.sample` reserve table now has the measured cell.

## 2026-09-17

### Fixed (PR #41 review, jvr0x — all three blocking findings and six non-blocking)

- **`PLE_GIB` is a documented constant again; the `model-ple*` shard
  derivation is gone.** The derivation matched zero files on every real
  checkpoint layout — the stock snapshot's `weight_map` has no
  `model-ple*` entries and NVIDIA's packs its 47.68 GiB PLE table inside
  `model-fp8-mtp-ple.safetensors`, whose name contains no `model-ple` — so
  the 26.82 fallback was the only path that ever ran, costing a spurious
  WARN on every stock launch and, on the NVIDIA checkpoint, a 20.86 GiB
  overstatement of GPU-resident weights that refused to boot
  (`HOST_RESERVE_GIB` cap). Merged from upstream #47 alongside its
  `MTP_WEIGHTS_GIB` companion knob (draft weights packed with the PLE
  table, credited back at MTP 0).
- **`stop.sh` validates `STOP_TIMEOUT` before use.** `docker stop -t abc`
  exits 125 on a bad value; the `|| true` swallowed it and the
  unconditional `docker rm -f` SIGKILLed the container while the output
  still read "stopped" — silently downgrading the graceful stop (and
  reintroducing the shm leak the SIGTERM path exists to avoid). Now a
  non-integer `STOP_TIMEOUT` is a hard error before anything is touched.
- **A manual `./stop.sh` can no longer resurrect itself.** The stopping
  flag now records its author: a `manual` first line (stop.sh) is held
  forever — the supervisor never reclaims it — while a maintenance-window
  flag is still reclaimed loudly after `STOPPING_MAX_AGE_S` (a crashed
  maintenance wrapper must not wedge supervision forever). stop.sh will
  not overwrite an existing flag (an emergency inside a maintenance
  window keeps the window's flag; the supervisor keeps leaving it alone).
- **The supervisor's hold is no longer silent**: both the manual-stop and
  the maintenance-window holds log once an hour instead of nothing.
- **A failed launch no longer destroys its own evidence**: each attempt
  writes `logs/supervise-start-<ts>.log`; `supervise-start.log` symlinks
  the newest, old attempts rotate (keep 10).
- **Backoff is charged to failed attempts only**: the first attempt on a
  clean cold start (or first tick after reboot) fires immediately instead
  of idling 30 s (was `30 * 2^lf` slept before the attempt, including
  `lf=0`).
- **`clean_shm` follows `stop.sh`'s rule** ("their segments are not ours
  to remove"): still refuses to delete anything a live process holds, and
  now also refuses when neither `fuser` nor `lsof` can prove the segments
  unheld — reporting instead of removing. Both files label the figure as
  *allocated* MiB (POSIX shm is not sparse; the old figure read like a
  du total).
- **`.env.sample` carries one reserve table** consolidating the three
  recommendations (26 stock / 28 at `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8` / 30 NVIDIA
  checkpoint) that previously drifted in three places, plus an explicit
  note that the `BIND=0.0.0.0` default is a deliberate choice with
  `API_KEY` as the control.

## 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Spanish-extended draft vocabulary for deployments serving Spanish**
  (oscarmenendezgarcia's `gb10-host-adaptation` work, taken as files with
  authorship preserved in history). `files/draft_vocab_es_en_code_65k.txt`:
  65,536 rows built by `files/build_draft_vocab_extend.py` — the shipped 47k
  file whole as a floor (verified: 0 of our 47,172 ids missing) plus 668 MiB
  of Spanish Wikipedia at natural frequencies, byte-fallback range pinned.
  Measured on his host with an interleaved ABBA protocol (five prompts per
  language, drift-cancelling): **Spanish 32.6 → 41.9 tok/s (+28.6%),
  acceptance 0.94 → 1.56, English unchanged**, for 9% of the draft-head byte
  saving. Root cause: the 47k English+code file covers only 64.4% of Spanish
  output occurrences — the reduced-vocab win was largely an English win, and
  nobody had measured Spanish. Quality is unaffected either way (rejection
  sampling; ~60,000 audited Spanish tokens, zero replacement characters,
  zero dialect-drift markers) — this is purely the speed of Spanish traffic.
  Switch with `MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB=files/draft_vocab_es_en_code_65k.txt`.
  Companion harnesses: `bench/audit-spanish.py` (per-paragraph Spanish
  quality gate), `bench/structured-protocol.py`, `bench/verify-smoke.py`,
  and the full write-up `docs/spanish-drafting-and-performance-2026-09-13.md`
  — which also documents two findings beyond drafting: sampling parameters
  differ per mode (thinking vs instruct) and mismatches cause language
  mixing, and structured-vs-realistic benchmark families are not comparable
  across recipes.

### Fixed

- **`build_draft_vocab.py` pins byte-level fallback tokens** (PR #43,
  oscarmenendezgarcia). Special/added tokens were already kept
  unconditionally; byte-level tokens (`<0xNN>`, the pieces BPE falls back to
  for every multi-byte UTF-8 sequence — accented Latin, CJK, emoji) lived or
  died by corpus frequency, and on a small or narrow corpus they were
  silently dropped (measured: 376 vs 286 ids below 400 on 513 MiB wikitext vs
  11.7 MB conversation logs), leaving the drafter proposing badly at exactly
  those boundaries. The builder now pins all 256 byte-level ids alongside the
  33 special/added. The shipped `draft_vocab_en_code_47k.txt` gains the 23
  ids English frequency alone had not kept (À Á Ð å æ ç è ñ ò ó ô õ ö ÷ ø ù
  ú û ü ý þ ÿ č) — 47,149 → 47,172 rows, pure addition, no removals.
  Correctness is unchanged (rejection sampling); non-English and mixed
  traffic drafts better. For Spanish traffic specifically, see the 65k
  Spanish-extended vocabulary in Added above.

## 2026-09-11

### Added

- **`CHAT_TEMPLATE` knob and the froggeric v22.5 fixed chat template**
  (`files/chat-template/chat_template.jinja`, Apache-2.0,
  hf.co/froggeric/Qwen-Fixed-Chat-Templates). Setting `CHAT_TEMPLATE` mounts
  the file into the container read-only, passes `--chat-template`, and
  switches the tool parser from `qwen3_coder` to `qwen3_xml` (the template
  emits canonical XML tool calls). It fixes the checkpoint's stock template
  on three real cases: `raise_exception` on `reasoning_effort` aliases
  ("high"/"minimal"/"none" from OpenAI/Claude Code/Cline clients), a crash on
  stringified-JSON tool arguments in history, and the xhigh-by-default
  reasoning token burn; it also adds inline `<|think_off|>` / `<|think_low|>`
  / `<|think_xhigh|>` steering. Verified live on this host: all four probe
  classes pass, and a follow-up tool call round-trips through `qwen3_xml`.
  Decode throughput is unchanged (the template is prompt-side). Client note:
  with thinking off via `<|think_off|>` or `reasoning_effort="none"`, short
  answers land in `reasoning_content` (vLLM qwen3 parser + prefilled closed
  think block); explicit `enable_thinking=false` routes to `content`.
- **`bench/structured.py`** — concurrent structured-decode bench (counting
  stream, 400 tokens, T=0, thinking off) for when sparkDash is not running.
  Measured on this host at `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8`, `HOST_RESERVE_GIB=28`: 65.2 /
  116.2 / 205.9 / 313.6 aggregate tok/s at 1/2/4/8 streams (per-stream 67.7 /
  60.7 / 53.9 / 42.8). Not comparable to the README prose tables — the
  counting stream is MTP's best case — it exists so structured-prompt numbers
  published for this runtime elsewhere can be compared like-for-like.

### Changed

- **The API binds `0.0.0.0` by default again** (`BIND`), reversing the
  loopback-by-default migration. The box is a server; the guardrail is the
  existing no-key path: with no `API_KEY` / `--api-key`, `start.sh` warns and
  lists the exposed interfaces. `BIND=127.0.0.1` restores loopback-only
  (ssh-tunnel access). The shell-metacharacter validation on `BIND` is
  unchanged.
- **`.env.sample` documents the `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8` + `HOST_RESERVE_GIB=28`
  pairing.** Measured 2026-09-11: at `HOST_RESERVE_GIB=26` the 8-width
  graph-capture spike pushed the driver to ~103 GiB, MemFree under 2 GiB for
  5 samples with 3 NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY lines, and the watchdog emergency-stopped
  the launch (exit 137, logs archived). At 28 the identical launch came up
  clean; KV drops to 14.60 GiB ≈ 916,845 FP8 tokens (~3.5 full 262k
  contexts). The ten-launch 16.67 GiB profile in the `KV_TARGET_GIB` comment
  was measured at `MAX_NUM_SEQS=4`.

## 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- **`API_KEY` was baked into `.last_launch.sh` in plaintext** (`5da6eb8`).
  The `--api-key` flag was built through `VLLM_ARGS_STR`, whose expansions the
  unquoted launch heredoc evaluates at script-generation time — so every
  launch wrote the key value into the generated script, the same on-disk-secret
  class as the #9 HF_TOKEN fix. The flag now lives in the heredoc body as
  `--api-key \$API_KEY` and resolves from the generated script's environment at
  exec time, exactly like HF_TOKEN. Render verified with a fake key: the
  generated script carries the placeholder, never the value, and omits the
  flag entirely when the key is empty. (Found during the 2026-09-10 upstream
  issues audit; keys written by earlier launches should be rotated.)
- **`smoke-test.sh` could not authenticate against an authenticated server**
  (`f29f547`). It never read `.env`, so a deployment with `API_KEY` (or
  `--api-key` inside `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS`) got 401s on every generation check —
  which meant the Sunday-04:00 maintenance smoke failed, the window's
  `logs/stopping` flag was never released, and the supervisor held off
  relaunching. It now reads `.env` repo-relative with environment-over-`.env`
  precedence (same rule as start.sh) and, when the `API_KEY` knob is unset,
  extracts the key from `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` with the same word-split semantics
  start.sh uses.
- **`health-probe.sh` silently clobbered its caller's environment**
  (`bdeb0e0`). It sourced `.env` without capturing `PORT`/`API_KEY` first, so
  environment values lost to `.env` — breaking the repo's stated precedence
  rule — and it 401'd against an authenticated server, which would have made
  the supervisor read a healthy server as wedged. Same env-wins fix plus the
  same `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` key fallback. Verified live against the running
  authenticated server: probe exit 0, smoke 6 passed / 1 expected determinism
  WARN.

## 2026-09-09

### Added

- **24/7 supervision loop** (`scripts/supervise.sh`, `scripts/start-memwatch.sh`
  and systemd user units in `systemd/`). The container now runs without docker
  `--restart`; the supervisor is the single state machine that keeps the
  container and the memory watchdog up, health-checks once a minute, recovers
  from crashes with exponential backoff (30 s × 2ⁿ, capped at 15 min), and
  holds a file-backed circuit breaker: 3 emergencies in a 2 h rolling window
  open it, after which it alerts only and waits for a human to re-arm by
  removing `logs/supervisor.state`. Counters survive supervisor restarts and
  reset on host reboot. A systemd `OnFailure=` target fires `alert.sh` when the
  unit fails. Install steps live in the README's "Unattended operation"
  section.

  *Credit where due: several detection and prevention patterns in this 2026-09-09
  section — sha256 verification with a paginated HF tree manifest, the
  quant_algo dispatch pre-flight, the MTP ring-capacity legality formula, the
  JIT compile fan-out bounds, the empty-cell (`completion_tokens > 0`) probe
  assertion, and the async-scheduling/MTP interaction — were drawn from the
  failure-mode notes of `jschmied/qwen38-flash-next-gb10` (same model, same
  GB10 hardware, a different engine build we do not run), then re-derived and
  verified against our own image and measurements.*
- **Continuous health probe** (`scripts/health-probe.sh`): stateless single-shot
  check — `/health` must answer 200, then a real 16-token generation must
  return a `finish_reason` and `usage.completion_tokens > 0` (the model
  emits reasoning first, so a naive length check would otherwise "pass" on an
  empty answer). The supervisor owns the consecutive-failure counter (5 →
  emergency) and only escalates when `/health` also stops answering, so probe
  queueing under load cannot stop a healthy saturated server. Latency is
  appended to `logs/probe-latency.log`.
- **Alerting** (`scripts/alert.sh`): POSTs one JSON payload
  `{hostname,timestamp,message,container,mem_available}` to `ALERT_WEBHOOK`,
  collapses identical messages to one per 15 min, is a silent no-op when the
  knob is unset, and never changes control flow on failure. Wired into the
  supervisor (relaunch failures, breaker trips, emergencies), the watchdog's
  stop path, the systemd failure target, the maintenance window and the daily
  heartbeat.
- **Scheduled graceful relaunch** (`scripts/maintenance-relaunch.sh`, timer at
  Sun 04:00): drains in-flight requests (`vllm:num_requests_running` down to 0,
  up to `MAINT_DRAIN_S` = 600 s), then `stop.sh` → `start.sh` →
  `smoke-test.sh`, and releases the `logs/stopping` handshake only once the new
  server is healthy, so the supervisor does not fight the maintenance window.
- **Daily heartbeat** (`scripts/heartbeat.sh`): reports uptime, restart count
  from supervisor state, `MemAvailable` and disk free on the checkpoint volume
  every day. Unconditional by design — silence must read as "running".
- **Per-launch smoke test** (`scripts/smoke-test.sh`), run after every start
  and inside the maintenance window: `/health`, model metadata, a coherent
  generation, temperature-0 determinism (WARN-only — the stock top-k kernel is
  non-deterministic), decode speed (≥ 15 tok/s), a tool-call round-trip (also
  settles the `qwen3_coder` vs `qwen3_xml` parser question on first launch)
  and the `/metrics` endpoint.
- **sha256 verification in `download.sh`** (`VERIFY_SHA256`, default on): the
  Hugging Face tree API is fetched with pagination (`Link: rel="next"`, 50/page)
  and the entry count is printed; every LFS blob's `lfs.sha256` is then checked
  against the file on disk, naming the offender and exiting 1 on a mismatch.
  Verified blobs are recorded in a `.sha256state` file beside the snapshot so a
  rerun skips them instead of re-hashing the whole ~99 GiB. Catches the failure
  class where `aria2` preallocates to the final size and then writes corrupt
  bytes, which size checks alone cannot see.
- **Quantization dispatch pre-flight in `start.sh`** (disable with
  `QUANT_PREFLIGHT_DISABLED=1`): reads `quant_algo` from the checkpoint's
  `quantization_config` and asks the image's `ModelOptMixedPrecisionConfig`
  whether it dispatches that algo, once per launch in a throwaway container
  (~30 s, no GPU work), refusing to launch on a mismatch. An undispatched algo
  would silently fall back to `UnquantizedLinearMethod` and load packed FP8
  bytes as BF16 — fluent garbage with zero errors.
- **MTP legality guard in `start.sh`**: validates
  `MTP_NUM_SPECULATIVE_TOKENS` against the engine's ring capacity — the
  attention block size must divide
  `compress_ratio × ceil((compress_ratio + k) / compress_ratio)`. The block
  size is introspected from the image and cached keyed on the snapshot hash;
  when introspection cannot run, it falls back to the known-good set
  {0,2,3,4,9..12} for block 848 with a warning. k=1 is rejected as strictly
  dominated (same cache-block cost as k=2, half the decode gain). Also refuses
  `--async-scheduling` in `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` while MTP is enabled (silent
  n-gram corruption).
- **`MTP_DISABLE_BLOCK_DROP` knob**: when 1, merges
  `"disable_eagle_block_drop":true` into the speculative-config JSON
  (vllm#53388), removing MTP's fixed 1,600-token prefix-cache-block back-off per
  turn. Ships as an opt-in while it is being A/B measured.
- **Determinism env pass-through** (`VLLM_QSA_DET_TOPK`, `VLLM_MOE_DET_FINALIZE`,
  both default unset): plumbing only — deterministic top-k needs a compiled
  kernel object and bit-stable MoE finalize needs a FlashInfer autotune
  cache-key backport, so these flags take effect once the image carries the
  kernels. `GDN_DECODE_KERNEL` likewise ships unset: the default CUDA GDN
  kernel deterministically hangs the engine at c≈32 with FP8 projections, so
  the `triton` flip is deferred to a later release after a soak.

### Changed

- **`memwatch.sh`**: an emergency stop now writes
  `WATCHDOG EMERGENCY STOP <reason>` as its last log line and calls
  `scripts/alert.sh`; clean `stop.sh` paths produce neither, so the supervisor
  can tell an emergency from a human stop. New `LEAK TREND` line — once a day
  if the `driver` figure grows 4 GiB past its post-load baseline
  (`TREND_WARMUP_S`/`TREND_BASELINE_S`, so the weight-load ramp cannot fake a
  leak).
- **The API now binds loopback by default** (`BIND`, default `127.0.0.1`).
  Remote clients get connection refused until they set `BIND=0.0.0.0` — and
  serve with an `--api-key`, since `start.sh` warns about exposed interfaces
  otherwise — or use an ssh tunnel. `BIND` is validated against shell
  metacharacters (including newline/control bytes) before reaching the launch
  script.
- **`stop.sh` reads `.env`** for `TP1_CONTAINER_NAME` and touches
  `logs/stopping` so the supervisor holds off relaunching while the box is
  intentionally stopped.
- **Log rotation**: the container runs with `--log-opt max-size=50m
  --log-opt max-file=3`; `scripts/memwatch-rotate.sh` copy-truncates the
  memwatch log at 10 MB; `logs/archive/` is pruned to the newest 20 sets
  across `start.sh`, `stop.sh` and the rotate script, never deleting a set
  younger than `MIN_SET_AGE_S` (300 s) so the 10 s tick cannot race a
  just-written archive.
- **Readiness timeout**: `start.sh` waits up to `READY_TIMEOUT_S` (1800 s) for
  `/health`, prints a heartbeat line every ~60 s with elapsed time and the last
  `/health` code, and on timeout archives the container log to
  `logs/archive/<c>-<ts>-timeout.log`, removes the wedged container so the
  supervisor cannot relaunch over a still-registered name, and exits non-zero
  (retriable by the supervisor).
- **Memory budget**: `PLE_GIB` is now derived from the checkpoint's own PLE
  shard sizes (index.json `weight_map` keys matching `model-ple*`) instead of a
  hardcoded 26.82, so a future checkpoint change cannot silently mis-size the
  budget. The container env gains `MAX_JOBS=2` and `FLASHINFER_NVCC_THREADS=1`
  so the JIT compile fan-out after a driver upgrade cannot OOM the whole box.
- **HF_TOKEN hygiene**: the generated `.last_launch.sh` no longer contains the
  token value (it is resolved from the environment at exec time) and the file
  is written `chmod 600`.

### Fixed

- **`EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` is now word-split** (`read -ra`) so JSON configs or
  multiple args in a single value land in argv correctly. Quoting inside values
  is not supported (documented in `.env.sample`); heavy JSON belongs in the
  scalar-built config knobs instead.
- **`download.sh`'s download hint broke every checkpoint download**: a
  single-quote inside the Python block of the single-quoted bash string
  truncated it. The hint is now a double-quoted `DEFAULT_CMD` containing zero
  single quotes.
- **Supervisor state-file writes**: `state_set` now rewrites the file with
  awk instead of sed, so values containing `|` or `&` (for example the memwatch
  marker + mtime dedupe key) persist and overwrite correctly. The dedupe
  previously failed silently, which would have let one memwatch emergency
  re-count on every tick and trip the 3-emergency breaker.
- **Adopted containers can now emergency-stop**: the probe-failure counter is
  reset exactly once when the adoption grace expires instead of on every tick,
  which had both re-zeroed the counter between probes (making the 5-failure
  emergency unreachable) and rewritten the state file every 10 s.
- **The supervisor's relaunch hold-off no longer blinds it**: a fresh
  `logs/stopping` now gates relaunch *only* — a container that is actually up
  inside a maintenance window keeps its memwatch and probe supervision. The
  supervisor also cleans `/dev/shm` NUL-safely (`find -print0 | xargs -0`) and
  refuses to delete segments still held by another process.
- **Probe escalation corroborates before stopping**: consecutive probe failures
  only trigger the emergency stop when `/health` also stops answering; queue
  congestion under load is alerted and reset instead of stopping a healthy
  server.
- **`scripts/memwatch-rotate.sh` archive pruning now covers rotation-only
  sets.** Rotation creates `<c>-<ts>-memwatch.log` without a `-container.log`
  sibling; the prune previously only matched anchored sets, so rotated logs
  accumulated without bound. Set retention is strictly mtime-ordered and keeps
  the newest 20 prefixes.
- **`MEMWATCH_GRACE` is honored by the supervisor** (forwarded to
  `start-memwatch.sh`) instead of being a dead knob.
- **Alert rate-limiting records a delivery only after a successful POST**, so a
  webhook outage does not mark a message as sent and suppress its retries for
  15 minutes.

### Measured

- **Reduced-vocabulary MTP drafting is now the shipped default**
  (`.env.sample`, `start.sh`, `files/draft_vocab_en_code_47k.txt`). The +25%
  decode win from 2026-09-05 (76.9 → 63.9 ms/step single-stream, 36.9 → 46.3
  tok/s) was measured with `MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB` active, but the knob shipped
  empty, so a fresh clone ran the full 248k draft head and left ~17%
  single-stream on the table. `.env.sample` now points at the checked-in
  47,149-row code-tuned vocab (1.18 GiB head → 0.22 GiB slice, ~2.9 GiB saved
  per MTP-3 step), `start.sh` resolves relative paths against the repo, errors
  when the file is missing, and warns when MTP runs with the full head. Empty
  the knob to restore full drafting. Correctness is structural (rejection
  sampling), so the worst case for poor coverage is slower decode, never wrong
  output.

  The shipped file was built on this host from 30 MiB of host code + docs
  (8.9M token occurrences, 47k distinct ids, 100% corpus coverage, 99.58%
  held-out on an 80/20 split) with `files/build_draft_vocab.py`, not from the
  wikitext+python+model-output corpus behind the measured 65k vocab (97.3%
  model-output coverage, MGSM en 94.8% vs 93.6%, zh 86.4% vs 86.4%). Code
  traffic should match the published gain; non-code traffic (especially
  Chinese) may draft worse — watch per-position acceptance in `/metrics`
  (`spec_decode_num_accepted_tokens_per_pos_total`) and rebuild from your own
  output if it drops under ~88% coverage.

  Measured live on this host 2026-09-09 with `bench/sweep.py` driving
  sparkDash (prose and code, 600 tokens, S=1/2/4/8, three repeats each,
  alternating order), one launch per arm at `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8` with everything
  else identical (262k native, MTP 3, FP8 KV, BF16 SSM, 2,048 chunks, FULL
  decode graphs). Aggregate decode tok/s, means of three:

  | | baseline (full head) | tuned (47k vocab) | change |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | code, 1 stream | 50.6 | **61.5** | **+21.5%** |
  | code, 2 streams | 89.5 | **102.2** | +14.2% |
  | code, 4 streams | 144.5 | **158.9** | +10.0% |
  | code, 8 streams | 231.7 | **252.6** | +9.0% |
  | prose, 1 stream | 40.9 | **46.8** | +14.4% |
  | prose, 2 streams | 65.6 | **74.0** | +12.8% |
  | prose, 4 streams | 98.0 | **112.2** | +14.5% |
  | prose, 8 streams | 149.4 | **162.0** | +8.4% |

  **+13.1% mean across the eight cells.** Every tuned cell's worst repeat beats
  the baseline's best (S=4 is the noisiest: tuned code 150.7–165.8, prose
  106.2–118.0). The gain is all step time — code 75.8→62.5 ms at one stream,
  prose 72.8→60.6 — with tokens per step unchanged (code 3.86, prose ~2.8):
  the byte saving with acceptance preserved, exactly the mechanism the 65k
  work predicted. Peak single reps: 62.3 tok/s code single-stream, 261.9
  aggregate at 8 streams. An earlier direct-curl check agreed (+30% median on
  a 200-token code prompt). The server log confirms 47,149/248,320 rows and
  2.88 GiB saved per step; KV pool 1,164,270 → 1,177,451 tokens (restart
  variation); `MemAvailable` min 12.2 GiB, 0 `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY`, no watchdog
  event on either arm. Raw rows: `logs/sweep-{baseline,tuned}.jsonl`.

### Known open

- `GDN_DECODE_KERNEL` stays unset this release by design; the `triton` flip is
  deferred until after a soak produces evidence. `VLLM_USE_DEEP_GEMM` relevance
  on this image has not been checked yet.
- The ABLIT PLE identity check (verifying the ablit snapshot's PLE shards equal
  the stock ones before reusing the packed table) is not implemented; `start.sh`
  still warns that the `edit_ple` flag alone does not prove identity, and 17 of
  34 PLE shards are known to differ between the two snapshots.
- `MTP_DISABLE_BLOCK_DROP` is shipped but the A/B measurement deciding whether
  it becomes a default is still open.
- The dispatch pre-flight and MTP introspection each launch a throwaway
  container (~30 s, no GPU work) per launch; if that is too slow on this box,
  cache the results keyed on (image digest, snapshot hash).

## 2026-09-06

Overnight measurement pass through `docs/synthesis-astra-fable-2026-09-05.md`
section 6: ten launches, one configuration each, every number from
`bench/sweep.py` driving sparkDash one concurrency level at a time and reading
the vLLM counters around it. Full write-up and every table in
`docs/overnight-2026-09-05.md`; raw rows in `logs/overnight-2026-09-05.jsonl`.

### Added

- **`ABLIT` 0/1 flag** (`.env`, `start.sh`, `download.sh`). `ABLIT=1` serves
  the gated Keys checkpoint
  `drowzeys/keys-Qwen3.8-flash-next-ablit-Mia-Single-Spark-only` (Mia-layout
  QSA `o_proj` splice at L15/19/23/27/31/35/39/43/47). The download is the
  **full** ~99 GiB snapshot so Hugging Face's terms gate stays in force —
  accept access on the repo page, then `ABLIT=1 ./download.sh` with
  `HF_TOKEN`. It is the same size as stock to the byte (9 of 37 shards differ
  in content, none in length — as later measured per-shard and filed upstream
  as #34, the true figures are 17 of 34 model shards, 35 counting the amax
  sidecar; see the 2026-09-09 "Known open" note below). The packed PLE table
  is reused from stock, but
  only after `ABLIT_META.json` is confirmed to report `edit_ple: false`.
  `TP1_MODEL_ID` still overrides checkpoint selection. `README.md` summarises
  the gate's terms (18+, stated intended use, prohibited uses, Qwen Community
  License) rather than just telling you to accept them, adds the ablit
  checkpoint to what the AGPL does *not* cover, and gains a **Credits**
  section crediting Qwen/Alibaba, MiaAI Lab, local-inference-lab and Keys
  (drowzeys) for the splice, mirroring the checkpoint's own `CREDITS.md`.

- **BF16 GDN recurrent state** (`MAMBA_SSM_CACHE_DTYPE`, `start.sh`).
  **+8.5% aggregate decode at 8 streams, with long-context retrieval
  unchanged.** The checkpoint sets `mamba_ssm_dtype = float32`, but the fused
  GDN kernel accepts bfloat16 as well (`FUSED_GDN_STATE_DTYPES` in
  `qwen_gdn_linear_attn.py`), and the state is pure per-step traffic: ~0.23 GB
  per sequence read and written every engine step. Halving it also halves the
  mamba page, which drops the attention block from 3,200 to 1,664 tokens.

  Measured on this host, `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8`, MTP 3, FP8 KV, 512k YaRN, prose,
  600 tokens, three repeats each:

  | streams | float32 state | bfloat16 state | delta |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | 44.6 tok/s | 47.6 tok/s | +6.8% |
  | 2 | 68.9 tok/s | 73.3 tok/s | +6.4% |
  | 4 | 107.8 tok/s | 111.1 tok/s | +3.1% |
  | 8 | **151.6 tok/s** | **164.5 tok/s** | **+8.5%** |

  Only the 8-stream row clears this host's decision bar (more than 5% in the
  same direction in all three repeats: +10.6%, +7.4%, +7.6%); the rest are
  positive but inside the ±5% noise floor. The gain is in the step, not in
  drafting: 141.4 → 130.4 ms at 8 streams with tokens per step unchanged at
  2.80 and per-position acceptance unchanged within rounding (0.80/0.59/0.41
  against 0.79/0.58/0.42). The KV pool is
  marginally larger for marginally less memory (17.3 GiB / 1,161,935 tokens →
  16.64 GiB / 1,180,814), which is the smaller mamba page showing up.

  **Quality is unchanged, and it was checked because this is a precision
  change.** `bench/longctx.py` at 32k, five runs: 15/15 needles found, 5/5
  PASS, at 5%, 50% and 95% depth — exactly the float32 pass count on the same
  five runs. A 4-turn continuation, which is what would expose a recurrence
  degrading across turns, ends on a summary that recalls every element of the
  conversation in both configurations. Three fixed sanity prompts agree.
  Caveat: that is one night's evidence at 32k, on the same bar the FP8 KV
  default was held to, not a graded task eval. `MAMBA_SSM_CACHE_DTYPE` empty
  restores the checkpoint's float32.

  Confirmed independently on a second launch (the final one, which then soaked
  45 minutes): 48.7 / 74.6 / 113.7 / 162.9 tok/s at 1/2/4/8 streams, +7.4% at
  8 streams against the float32 baseline in all three repeats.

- **`VLLM_USE_V2_MODEL_RUNNER=1` in `.env.sample`'s `EXTRA_DOCKER_ARGS`.** This
  architecture already selects the V2 model runner for the target, but the
  speculative draft config copy (`Qwen3_8FlashNextMTP`) is not in the V2
  default set, falls back to V1, and mutates the `compilation_config` object it
  shares with the target. That is the mechanism behind the 2026-09-05
  dynamic-K failure, where `cudagraph_mode` silently became PIECEWISE. Pinned
  on all ten launches here: none logged `Overriding cudagraph_mode`, and every
  launch that reached `/health` captured the FULL decode graph list `start.sh`
  asked for.

- **`bench/sweep.py` and `bench/mixed.py`.** Verified against the 2026-09-05
  sparkDash anchors before use: 47.8/71.2/106.7 tok/s at S=1/2/4 against
  46.1/70.3/107.0, and 63.0 ms per step at S=1 against the reduced-head
  63.9 ms. See their own entry below.

- **An INFO line in the MTP patch when index sharing engages**
  (`files/patch_mtp_draft_vocab.py`). See "Tried and rejected".

### Changed

- **`KV_TARGET_GIB` 16 -> 20 in `.env.sample`**, so the shipped wish matches the
  value every measurement in this entry was taken at. It is a wish, not a
  grant: with `HOST_RESERVE_GIB=26` this host clips it on every launch
  (`KV target 20 reduced to 16.67 by HOST_RESERVE_GIB=26`, and to 18.16 on the
  K=0 launch, where the draft weights are not resident). What survives vLLM's
  own profiling is 15.98 GiB = 1,132,586 FP8 tokens on the final launch. The
  host margin is unchanged because the cap, not this knob, bounds the budget:
  ten launches and a 45-minute soak at 20, `MemAvailable` 15.52-16.42 GiB
  through the soak and never below 13.0 GiB under the sweeps, 0
  `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` after `/health`. On a host with more memory the cap is
  looser and 20 may be granted in full. `README.md` updated in the five places
  that named 16 as the shipped value.

### Fixed

- **Snapshot resolution picked the wrong directory** (`start.sh`,
  `download.sh`). Both scripts took `ls "$MODEL_PATH/snapshots" | head -1`,
  which is alphabetical by commit hash, not by state. With more than one
  snapshot in the cache — a revision bump, or an aborted download left beside a
  finished one — that could resolve to an incomplete tree, so `start.sh` failed
  the shard check on a checkpoint that was actually present. Both now share a
  `resolve_snapshot` helper that prefers `refs/main` when complete, then the
  newest complete snapshot, and falls back to an incomplete one only so
  `download.sh` can resume it.

### Measured

- **Static K sweep, 0/1/2/3, at 1/2/4/8 streams, with FULL decode graphs
  throughout — the open question from the synthesis document, settled.**
  `CUDAGRAPH_CAPTURE_SIZES=auto` recomputes the widths per K, so every launch
  had a FULL graph for every verify batch its scheduler could build. Aggregate
  decode tok/s, prose, three repeats, mean:

  | streams | K=0 | K=1 | K=2 | K=3 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | 24.3 | 38.2 | 44.3 | **44.6** |
  | 2 | 41.9 | 61.8 | **69.4** | 68.9 |
  | 4 | 68.5 | 95.0 | 103.9 | **107.8** |
  | 8 | 103.3 | 138.7 | 150.1 | **151.6** |

  **K=3 is optimal at every concurrency, K=2 is statistically tied to it, and
  there is no crossover.** The question was whether K=1 wins at 8 streams; it
  loses 8.5% there. The single historical data point that suggested otherwise
  (step 160.8 → 127.4 ms at S=8) was taken under PIECEWISE graphs, where the
  K=3 side was paying a graph penalty it does not pay now.

  Engine step (ms) / tokens per step behind those numbers:

  | streams | K=0 | K=1 | K=2 | K=3 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | 41.1 / 1.00 | 48.7 / 1.86 | 55.9 / 2.46 | 62.9 / 2.83 |
  | 8 | 76.4 / 1.00 | 102.2 / 1.84 | 124.7 / 2.42 | 141.4 / 2.80 |

  Each draft position costs a near-constant slice of step time (~7 ms at 1
  stream, ~22 ms at 8, flat across positions) and returns its own acceptance in
  tokens. Positions 1 and 2 return 0.80 and 0.60, well above break-even;
  position 3 returns 0.41, which is close enough to break-even that K=2 and
  K=3 tie. Acceptance on the earlier positions *rises* as the draft shortens
  (p1 = 0.79 / 0.82 / 0.86 at K=3/2/1, one stream) — the positions are not
  independent — but not by enough to change the ranking. Disabling MTP costs
  32–46%, and returns 1.49 GiB: the KV pool goes from 17.3 GiB / 1,161,935
  tokens to 17.9 GiB / 1,389,215.

- **8-stream decode is 151.6 tok/s, not 114.** The 114 figure in the
  2026-09-05 entry was measured before `CUDAGRAPH_CAPTURE_SIZES=auto` covered
  all eight verify widths; with a FULL graph at every width from 4 to 32 the
  8-stream step is 141.4 ms rather than 146.2. `MAX_NUM_SEQS` still ships at 4:
  all of tonight's sweeps were short-context, and 8 concurrent full-length
  requests do not fit the KV pool.

- **What a long prefill does to streams that are already decoding**, on the
  shipped 2,048-token chunk: two decoders at 76 ms inter-token latency, one
  64k prompt injected, and for the 34.5 s that prompt takes to prefill the
  decoders' ITL p50 is 1,057 ms, p95 1,111 ms, p99 1,400 ms, with aggregate
  decode across both streams falling to 2.14 tok/s. The p50 is the mechanism
  in one number: a 2,048-token chunk at this host's ~2,100 tok/s is 0.97 s of
  GPU time, and chunked prefill puts one chunk in the same engine step as every
  co-scheduled decode. The decoders do not get slower steps, they get one step
  per chunk.

- **Prefill is unchanged by anything in this entry.** Three sparkDash ladders
  on the final configuration: 2,304 / 2,314 / 2,257 / 2,146 / 1,944 tok/s at
  16k / 32k / 64k / 128k / 256k, within 2.2% of the 2026-09-05 pass at every
  context, and reproducing to +/-0.05% between ladders at 64k and 128k. The 8k
  row reads +24.7% (1,764 -> 2,200) but is a cache artifact: fitting
  `TTFT = tokens / rate + overhead` over 16k-128k gives 2,125 tok/s now against
  2,089 then, +1.7%, with the same -0.60 s intercept, and the 8k point sits
  above the fit in both ladders (+1.34 s in 2026-09-05, +0.47 s here) because
  it runs first and pays the PLE page-cache warm-up. BF16 recurrent state moves
  decode, not prefill.

- **Restart-to-restart KV variation is ~10% on this host.** Two launches with
  identical memory settings resolved to 17.3 GiB / 1,161,935 tokens and
  15.59 GiB / 1,045,742. Worth knowing before reading a small KV difference as
  a result.

### Tried and rejected

- **MTP sparse-index reuse (`index_share_for_mtp_iteration`)** — not
  measurable from the CLI on this build. `--hf-overrides` puts the flag on the
  target's `text_config`; the drafter reads it from the *draft* config, and
  `SpeculativeConfig.compose_draft_hf_overrides` states that "Dict overrides
  are target-specific key patches and are not applied to the draft". The added
  INFO line never fired on a launch whose command line did carry the flag. No
  knob shipped: a switch that silently does nothing is worse than no switch.
- **`flashinfer_b12x` MoE backend** — selects for both processes
  (`Using 'FLASHINFER_B12X' NvFp4 MoE backend`), then kills the engine during
  `profile_run` with `CUDA error: an illegal memory access was encountered`,
  before the KV pool is sized. The exclusion of this backend from `auto` in
  `oracle/nvfp4.py` is load-bearing on SM121, not stale. No host risk: 0
  `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY`, no watchdog event, driver memory returned in full.
- **`MTP_NUM_SPECULATIVE_TOKENS` 2, 1 and 0** — −0.8%, −14.4% and −45.5% at one
  stream against K=3. K=3 stays the default.
- **Dynamic K (`MTP_K_SCHEDULE`)** — not run. It was conditional on the static
  sweep finding a per-S optimum other than K=3, and the optimum is K=3 at every
  S. There is nothing to schedule.
- **`COMPILATION_MODE=3`** with `CUDAGRAPH_MODE=FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` — +0.3% at
  one stream and +1.0% at four, both inside noise. It is safe (loads, compiles
  in 13 s, keeps FULL decode graphs, does not disturb the PLE custom op) and
  buys nothing: decode here is bandwidth-bound and fusion only helps the part
  of the step that is not.
- **`MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=1024`** — a near miss, kept as an opt-in rather
  than promoted. Under the mixed-traffic test it takes the decoders' ITL p95
  during a 64k prefill from 1,111 ms to 666 ms (1.67x) and p99 from 1,400 ms
  to 674 ms (2.08x), and raises aggregate decode during the prefill window from
  2.14 to 3.45 tok/s, for 5.5% of prefill at 64k and 17% of the prompt's TTFT.
  The bar for changing the shipped default was 2x on **p95**, and p95 is 1.67x.
  For prefill-dominated agent traffic this is very likely the better setting;
  make the case on p99 and re-measure on your own traffic.

## 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- **The GPU budget had no term for the host, and three servers died of it**
  (2026-09-04, `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, under a five-agent qwen-code harness sending
  370 requests averaging 72k input tokens). `start.sh` sized the GPU budget as
  `weights + overhead + MTP + KV_TARGET_GIB` and vLLM, which detects this GPU
  as integrated and treats host `MemAvailable` as free GPU memory, filled the
  GPU side to exactly that number. That left 20.7 GiB of the 121.6 GiB pool for
  a host that needs at least 22: other containers and sessions ~7 GiB, vLLM's
  host-side processes ~6, PLE page cache ≥6, free pages the NVIDIA driver needs
  ≥3 — before 2–3 GiB of per-request growth that the CUDA caching allocator
  never returns while serving (this build's UMA release valve is only called
  from the model loader). The servers idled 1–3 GiB above the 6 GiB watchdog
  floor, the driver logged `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` at `MemFree` ~3 GiB, and the
  watchdog fired. The previous entry's reading of deaths 1–2 as watchdog noise
  was wrong; the debounce stays, it just was not the cause.

  `start.sh` now caps the budget from the host side:
  `min(weights + overhead + MTP + max(kv_need, KV_TARGET_GIB), MemTotal −
  HOST_RESERVE_GIB)`, `HOST_RESERVE_GIB` defaulting to 26, KV derived from the
  capped budget ("KV target 22 reduced to 16.67 by HOST_RESERVE_GIB=26"), and
  refuses to launch if the capped KV is under what `MAX_MODEL_LEN` needs. It
  prints the reserve and the live non-vLLM host footprint (warns above 9 GiB),
  and warns when a pinned `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` exceeds the cap. The cgroup
  cap logic is unchanged; GPU allocations are not charged to it on GB10, so it
  never protected the host from this. `.env.sample` ships `KV_TARGET_GIB=16`
  and `HOST_RESERVE_GIB=26`.

  Measured on this host, same day, shipped profile (262k, FP8, MTP 3,
  `MAX_NUM_SEQS=5`), no kernel tunables applied:

  | | old (`KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, GMU 0.830) | new (GMU 0.780) |
  |---|---|---|
  | GPU budget | 100.9 GiB | 94.87 GiB |
  | KV pool (FP8) | 22.2 GiB | 16.46 GiB = 992,584 tok (3.79x a 262k req) |
  | time to `/health` | — | 10 min 51 s |
  | host MemAvailable idle | 6.9–8.8 GiB | 15.7 GiB at +2 min; 15.5–16.4 over 40 min |
  | host MemFree idle | ~4.9 GiB | 4.4–5.2 GiB |
  | after two ~90k prompts | ~6.9 GiB, never back | 15.2 GiB 60 s after the second (min 14.9 during; MemFree ≥ 3.5) |
  | five concurrent ~60k prompts | died under the harness | 14.57 GiB at +60 s (min 14.26; MemFree ≥ 3.24); 5/5 completed, no watchdog event |
  | `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` (`journalctl -k`) | 63 between 16:50 and 23:59 on 2026-09-04 | **0** across launch, both tests and 50 idle minutes |

  The per-request growth is still there and is now budgeted for, not fixed:
  the first 90k prompt moved the watchdog's `driver` figure from 95.6 to
  96.4 GiB and `MemAvailable` from 16.2 to 15.05 GiB, permanently.
  The second 90k prompt added nothing (96.4 → 96.4 GiB); five concurrent 60k
  prompts added 0.2 GiB (96.6). Session minimum over launch, both tests and
  50 idle minutes: `MemAvailable` 14.26 GiB, `MemFree` 3.24 GiB.
  The qwen-code harness that killed the old config then ran against the new
  budget for 2.5 hours (~38 requests, 19 of them 50–100k tokens, 3 over 100k,
  up to 3 concurrent): no watchdog event, no driver error, `MemAvailable`
  14.2–14.9 GiB between turns and 12.8 GiB at the low point, the driver figure
  flat at 96.6 GiB for three hours then one 0.9 GiB step to 97.5 on a 3-way
  batch — the growth mechanism, absorbed by the reserve as intended.

- **Watchdog: a second floor, richer timeline, logs archived before the stop**
  (`files/memwatch.sh`). It now also stops the container when `MemFree` stays
  under `MEMWATCH_MIN_FREE_GIB` (default 2) for 5 samples — but only while
  `MemAvailable` is under `MEMWATCH_FREE_GATE_GIB` (default 10). The gate was
  learned the hard way: the ungated version killed a healthy launch at 00:49
  because `MemFree` fell to 0.9 GiB while 32 GiB of weights streamed through
  the page cache (`MemAvailable` 32 GiB, zero driver errors). With the stock
  kernel watermarks `MemFree` is only meaningful once the cache is gone.
  Every 10 s it counts `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` in `journalctl -k` and logs any
  non-zero count. The 5 s timeline adds `cached`, `anon`, `shmem`, `mapped`,
  `sunreclaim` and a derived `driver` figure (`MemTotal − MemFree − Buffers −
  Cached − AnonPages − Slab − PageTables − KernelStack`), which is where the
  growth shows. Before `docker stop` it writes `docker logs --tail 3000` and a
  copy of its own log to `logs/archive/`; the grace period is 30 s
  (`MEMWATCH_GRACE`), and `start.sh` archives the previous run's container and
  watchdog logs before it relaunches. Observed: vLLM ignores SIGTERM while
  loading weights, so a stop in that phase ends in the SIGKILL fallback.

- **`stop.sh` discarded the container log.** It ran `docker rm -f` with no
  copy; a run stopped by hand had no post-mortem. It now archives `docker logs
  --tail 3000` and the watchdog log to `logs/archive/` first, like `start.sh`
  and `memwatch.sh`.

- **Stale comment in `.env`**: `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=2048` was labelled
  "local override: faster prefill" from the reverted 8192 experiment.

### Added

- **Reduced-vocabulary drafting for the MTP head** (`files/patch_mtp_draft_vocab.py`,
  `files/build_draft_vocab.py`, `MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB`). **The largest measured win
  on this host: -16.9% single-stream step time, and the only change so far that
  moves single stream at all.**

  The drafter carries its own BF16 `ParallelLMHead` over the whole 248,320-token
  vocabulary, 1.18 GiB, read once per draft step. At MTP 3 that is three of the
  four `lm_head` reads in an engine step -- about a third of every byte a
  single-stream step moves -- to produce one argmax. Draft sampling is greedy
  (`draft_sample_method` defaults to `"greedy"`, and the speculator only builds
  `draft_logits` for `"probabilistic"`, so *every* draft goes through
  `get_top_tokens` regardless of request temperature), so the drafter needs the
  arg max and nothing else, and ~74% of the vocabulary never wins it.

  The patch adds `get_top_tokens()` to `Qwen3_8FlashNextMTP`, reading a sliced
  BF16 head selected by token id, and leaves `compute_logits` on the full head
  so every other path keeps full-vocabulary behaviour. It engages only when
  `MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB` names a file, and `start.sh` then also passes
  `"use_local_argmax_reduction":true`, which is what routes the speculator
  through `get_top_tokens`. TP=1 only; it refuses to engage otherwise.

  At 65,536 rows the draft head is 0.31 GiB, saving **2.61 GiB per engine step**.
  Measured step time against the same server with the full head:

  | streams | full head | reduced head | delta |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | 76.9 ms  | 63.9 ms  | **-16.9%** |
  | 2 | 93.0 ms  | 79.0 ms  | -15.1% |
  | 4 | 117.3 ms | 101.6 ms | -13.4% |
  | 5 | 127.4 ms | 115.7 ms | -9.2%  |
  | 8 | 155.7 ms | 146.2 ms | -6.1%  |

  Three repeats each; the byte model predicts -18.0% at one stream and -6.2% at
  eight, so prediction and measurement agree within about a point at both ends.
  The saving is a fixed 2.61 GiB while the step grows with concurrency (each
  extra token pulls in ~10 more of the 512 MoE experts), which is why the gain
  shrinks as streams rise. Decode-phase throughput: 28.4 -> ~35 tok/s at one
  stream, 84.7 -> 101.3 at five.

  **Accuracy is unaffected, and that is structural rather than lucky.** The
  rejection sampler's greedy branch is
  `accepted = target_argmax == draft_sampled`, storing
  `draft_sampled if accepted else target_argmax`: a draft is kept only when it
  equals the target model's own choice, and otherwise the target's token is
  emitted. The patch changes only what is *proposed*; the verification path is
  untouched, so a reduced-vocabulary drafter is indistinguishable from a less
  accurate one, which is the condition rejection sampling exists to handle.
  Confirmed on MGSM (the same 250 grade-school problems in each language, exact
  numeric match, 8 concurrent, temperature 0):

  | | reduced 65k | full 248k | delta |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | en accuracy | 237/250 = 94.8% | 234/250 = 93.6% | +1.2 pts (0.57 sigma) |
  | zh accuracy | 216/250 = 86.4% | 216/250 = 86.4% | 0.0 pts (0.00 sigma) |
  | en throughput | 95.2 tok/s | 83.9 tok/s | **+13.4%** |
  | zh throughput | 84.4 tok/s | 82.4 tok/s | +2.4% |

  Chinese is the stress case: the shipped vocabulary covers 50.6% of the tokens
  the model emits in Chinese against 98.9% in English, and Chinese accuracy is
  *identical* to the problem, 216 of 250 either way. What coverage buys is
  speed, never correctness -- English gains 13%, Chinese gains nothing
  measurable because the unconditional byte saving and the acceptance the poor
  coverage costs cancel out. Out-of-vocabulary traffic comes out break-even, not
  slower, so the reduced head is safe for mixed traffic.

  Exact-text A/B is not available on this server: two passes over the same 26
  temperature-0 prompts on one unchanged config produced 0/26 identical outputs.
  Concurrent batch composition changes MoE/Marlin reduction order and flips
  near-tied logits. That nondeterminism predates this change; it is why the
  kernel and a graded task eval are the evidence here rather than a diff.

  Building the vocabulary needs a real corpus, and this is the part that nearly
  sank the item. A vocabulary fitted to the model's own generated output does
  not work: 52 generations gave 4,250 distinct tokens, so every size from 8k to
  65k was the same set at 76% held-out coverage, and generating enough would
  take a day of the server doing nothing else. Qwen's BPE id order is also a
  poor frequency proxy -- "keep every id below 32,768" covers only 80.9% of
  occurrences. What worked was 513 MiB of wikitext-103 plus 47 MiB of real
  Python source (x3) plus the model's own output (x20): 160M token occurrences,
  104,522 distinct ids.

      python3 files/build_draft_vocab.py english.txt code.txt:3 model_out.jsonl:20 \
          --size 65536 --out ~/.cache/vllm/draft_vocab/qwen38fn_en_code_65k.txt

  Corpus coverage by size: 8k 87.1%, 16k 93.2%, 32k 97.8%, 65k 99.84%. On the
  model's own English+code output, 32k covers 93.7% and 65k covers 97.3%. 65k
  ships because the crossover where the acceptance loss eats the byte saving is
  around 88-90% coverage, and 65k costs only 3 points of byte saving (18.0% vs
  21.2% of a single-stream step) to buy 3.6 points of coverage. The vocabulary
  is a generated artifact and is not tracked here; `MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB` empty
  restores full-vocabulary drafting.

  Not free in memory: the full 1.18 GiB head stays resident and the 0.31 GiB
  slice is added on top, so this spends ~0.31 GiB of GPU memory to save
  bandwidth. Under greedy draft sampling `compute_logits` is dead on the draft
  path, so the full head could be released later for another 1.18 GiB.

- **Batched page prefetch before the PLE row gather** (`files/patch_ple_layer.py`,
  `files/patch_ple_offload.py`). The offload worker gathers 16 rows per token
  out of a 26.82 GiB mmap with `torch.index_select`, which never reaches
  PyTorch's ~32k-element parallel grain at decode sizes, so every missing 4 KiB
  page was faulted in one at a time on one thread while the GPU worker spun on
  the handshake. Measured in-container against the real table, 100% cold rows:
  a 280-row gather takes 20.12 ms (71.4 us/fault) and does not improve with
  more torch threads (1 -> 17.39 ms, 4 -> 16.35, 8 -> 16.34), confirming the
  serial loop. `_ple_prefetch_rows()` now maps the gather's row ids to page
  offsets, dedups them (`torch.unique`, so the reads issue in ascending file
  order) and names them all with `posix_fadvise(WILLNEED)` through an fd kept
  beside the mmap, before the gather runs: the same 280-row gather drops to
  **1.51 ms, 13x**. Advisory only and wrapped, so any failure falls back to
  today's path. End to end the win is smaller, because only ~20% of lookups
  miss the page cache (measured 5.51 pages/generated token at 1 stream, 3.55 at
  5 -- the README's older 57 KiB/token figure implied ~87%): **-3.2% mean step
  time across 1/2/4/5/6/8 streams**, every one of the six improving. The
  page-cache confound is ruled out -- the patched run faulted *more* pages than
  the unpatched one (6.47 vs 5.51 per token at 1 stream) and was still faster,
  which is the prefetch signature. Note the fault arithmetic alone predicts
  ~0.6-2%, so ~1-2% of the measured gain is unexplained.

- **`CUDAGRAPH_CAPTURE_SIZES`** (`start.sh`, `.env.sample`, default `auto`).
  vLLM builds its decode graph list as `[1,2,4]` plus multiples of 8, rounds
  each to a multiple of `1+MTP`, then keeps only sizes `<= (1+MTP)*MAX_NUM_SEQS`.
  At MTP 3 that leaves decode keys `{4,8,16}` whatever `MAX_NUM_SEQS` is: a
  3-sequence batch (12 tokens) pads up to 16 and reads a fourth request's worth
  of experts for nothing, and at `MAX_NUM_SEQS=5` a full 5-sequence batch (20
  tokens) matches no key and decodes eager. Confirmed from the engine log
  (`cudagraph_capture_sizes: [1,2,4,8,16,24,32,40]`, 3 graphs captured), not
  inferred. `auto` captures every `(1+K(S))*S` the scheduler can build, honouring
  `MTP_K_SCHEDULE` when one is set; at `MAX_NUM_SEQS=4` that is `[4,8,12,16]`
  and 4 graphs. Worth ~4-5 ms on the 5-sequence step (the marginal cost of the
  5th stream fell 16.1 -> 10.6 ms) and nothing at 1/2/4 streams, where the
  graphs already existed -- an order of magnitude less than the +20-25% that had
  been projected by attributing the whole gap to the eager fallback. Keep it
  anyway: it is free, and it is the precondition for any `MAX_NUM_SEQS > 4`.

- **`MTP_K_SCHEDULE`** (`start.sh`, `.env.sample`, default empty) — dynamic
  speculative depth per batch size, `"start:end:K,..."`. **Measured as a
  regression on this build; ships disabled.** Setting
  `num_speculative_tokens_per_batch_size` makes vLLM override `cudagraph_mode`
  from `FULL_DECODE_ONLY` to `PIECEWISE`, so the computed capture sizes are
  never used. The byte saving is real (K=1 at 8 streams cut the step 160.8 ->
  127.4 ms) but tokens/step fell 2.29 -> 1.68 and the graph penalty ate the
  rest: 105 vs 114 tok/s. The single-stream control, where K is 3 either way,
  isolates that penalty at **79.6 -> 99.0 ms, +24%** -- far more than graphs are
  worth at 5 streams, because kernel-launch overhead hides under memory traffic
  at concurrency and is exposed without it. It also broke the memory budget:
  PIECEWISE graph memory drove the driver to 99.4 GiB against a 94.87 GiB
  budget, `MemAvailable` to 9.1 GiB and `MemFree` to 1.9 GiB, and the watchdog
  stopped the server (`MemFree under 2 GiB for 5 samples`, 7 `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY`
  since watchdog start). The log names an untested escape hatch,
  `VLLM_USE_V2_MODEL_RUNNER=1`.

- **`COMPILATION_MODE`** (`start.sh`, `.env.sample`, default `0`) — torch.compile
  level, previously hard-coded. Untested above 0 here.

- **`files/sysctl-spark3.conf`** — `vm.min_free_kbytes=4194304`,
  `vm.watermark_scale_factor=300`, `vm.swappiness=30`, the values a sibling
  Spark measured six crash-free bring-ups with. `start.sh` warns when the box
  is at the kernel defaults (45155 / 10) and prints the `sysctl -p` command.
  **Not applied** by anything in this repo and not yet measured here: at those
  values the same physical state reads roughly 11–15 GiB lower in
  `MemAvailable` (computed from the kernel's watermark formula), so the 6 GiB
  watchdog floor has to be re-derived against a measured run first.

### Measured

- **End-to-end sweep after the optimisation pass**, sparkDash against the
  shipped profile (512k YaRN, 2,048 chunks, `MAX_NUM_SEQS=4`, MTP 3, FP8 KV,
  `KV_TARGET_GIB=20` -> 16.18 GiB = 974,768 tokens = 3.72x a 262k request).
  Same rope config and chunk width as the rows it replaces, so decode is a
  matched pair; prefill differs only in `KV_TARGET_GIB` (22 -> 20), which does
  not change the prefill rate. One run each.

  | decode, prose | before | after | change |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 stream  | 36.9 tok/s | **46.3** | **+25.5%** |
  | 2 streams | 57.4 tok/s | **73.0** | +27.2% |
  | 3 streams | -          | 91.9     | - |
  | 4 streams | 85.9 tok/s | **108.1** | +25.8% |

  | prefill | before | after | change |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 8k   | 1,646 tok/s | **1,764** (TTFT 4.67 s)   | +7.2%  |
  | 16k  | 2,052 tok/s | **2,265** (TTFT 7.25 s)   | +10.4% |
  | 32k  | 2,073 tok/s | **2,265** (TTFT 14.49 s)  | +9.3%  |
  | 64k  | 2,037 tok/s | **2,222** (TTFT 29.52 s)  | +9.1%  |
  | 128k | 1,945 tok/s | **2,110** (TTFT 62.15 s)  | +8.5%  |
  | 256k | 1,791 tok/s | **1,913** (TTFT 137.03 s) | +6.8%  |

  The single-stream decode figure independently reproduces the in-repo
  measurement taken with a different harness on different prompts (28.4 -> 35.7
  tok/s, +26%): different absolute numbers, same gain.

- **The prefill gain is the PLE prefetch, not the draft vocabulary**, which does
  not touch prefill at all. This reverses the priority the two items were given
  during the work. The PLE row gather runs per prefilled token, so a 2,048-token
  chunk gathers 16 rows per token -- about 32,768 of them -- against the ~256 a
  4-stream MTP-3 decode step gathers. That is the regime where batching the page
  faults measured 13x in isolation, and it explains why the same patch was worth
  only ~3% on decode: too few faults per step there for the fault latency to
  matter. So the gather fix is worth roughly three times more on prefill than on
  decode, and it was ranked last on decode evidence alone. Not isolated with an
  A/B -- attribution is inference from the mechanism, and one launch with
  `MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB` empty would separate the two.

- **Decode is on the memory-bandwidth wall, and that is what ranks the work.**
  Measured step time against the byte model in `docs/fable51-max.md`: 1.37x the
  floor at one stream, 1.09x at four, 1.04x at five, and 160.8 ms against a
  165 ms floor at eight. The consequence is that only *bytes removed* convert
  into time at concurrency. Reduced-vocabulary drafting was predicted at -18.0%
  and -6.2% at one and eight streams from the byte arithmetic alone and measured
  -16.9% and -6.1%, agreeing within about a point at both ends -- so the byte
  model can rank future work before a restart is spent on it. The two overhead
  items returned ~3% each; the one byte item returned 17%.

- **Run-to-run determinism.** Greedy decoding on this server is not
  reproducible: two passes over the same 26 temperature-0 prompts on one
  unchanged configuration produced 0/26 identical outputs, diverging 0.3-7% in.
  Concurrent batch composition changes MoE/Marlin reduction order and flips
  near-tied logits. This predates any change here and is why the draft-head
  comparison was settled with the rejection-sampler kernel and a graded task
  eval rather than a text diff.

## 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- **The memory watchdog killed healthy servers on a single noisy sample**
  (`c79f765`). `files/memwatch.sh` triggered on one `MemAvailable` reading below
  `MEMWATCH_MIN_GIB`. Two servers were lost to this; in both cases the samples
  either side of the trigger sat 400–700 MiB *above* the floor:

  ```
  23:32:32 avail=6542MiB          <- 398 MiB above the 6144 MiB floor
  23:32:33 MemAvailable=6090 MiB < floor -> docker kill
  ```

  `MemAvailable` moves ~107 MiB between 5 s samples here, with excursions past
  1 GiB, so a one-sample test against a fixed threshold fires on noise. The
  trigger now requires **5 consecutive** sub-floor samples; replayed against
  both recorded crash sequences it does not fire, and it still fires on a
  sustained decline. A lone excursion logs `recovered after N sub-floor
  sample(s)` and resets the counter.

  Not yet proven live: the debounce has not fired in real conditions, and the
  slow downward trend in `MemAvailable` under sustained long-context prefill is
  still unexplained.

- **The watchdog's own kill was invisible in its log** (`c79f765`). It polled
  every second but logged every fifth sample, so the reading that caused a kill
  was never in the post-mortem. It now logs every sample once within 1 GiB of
  the floor.

- **The watchdog leaked POSIX shared memory** (`c79f765`). It used `docker kill`
  (SIGKILL); with `--ipc host` that strands the container's `/dev/shm` segments
  until reboot — the leak `stop.sh` already takes care to avoid. It now sends
  SIGTERM with a 10 s grace period (`MEMWATCH_GRACE`) and falls back to SIGKILL.

- **An incomplete checkpoint got past the pre-flight check** (`b0a9f5e`).
  `start.sh` and `download.sh` treated "`config.json` exists" as "checkpoint
  complete", but `config.json` lands early in a download, so an interrupted
  fetch failed later inside vLLM instead. Both now require every shard named by
  `model.safetensors.index.json` (35 here). Catches missing and dangling-symlink
  shards, not truncated blobs. Split out of #2; co-authored with @lidaiqing.

### Changed

- **FP8 KV: per-tensor scales hoisted out of the QSA dots** (`69f7b4c`, from #2,
  co-authored with @lidaiqing). The kernels previously dequantised each tile with
  vLLM's `_cast_kv_tile`, which materialises an FP32 tile
  (`(data.to(tl.float32) * scale).to(Q.dtype)`); `block_n` was halved to keep
  that inside GB10's shared-memory budget. They now cast FP8→BF16 and apply the
  scalar scales after the dots, which removes the FP32 tile and restores the
  BF16 tile width.

  Exact before rounding: the score scale is a scalar, so it commutes with the
  `softmax_scale` multiply and the validity mask, and the output scale is
  applied to `normalized_output` above the `NUM_SPLITS` branch so it factors
  through the split-K LSE merge. Slightly *more* accurate than dequantising
  first, since FP8→BF16 is exact while rounding `scale × fp8` into BF16 is not.

  Measured by the contributor: +6.3% prefill @32k, −40.6% sparse-QSA kernel
  latency, one BF16 ULP maximum error, BF16 path bit-identical. End-to-end on
  this host the kernel alone came out around +3% at 32k against an unmatched
  baseline — inside run-to-run noise. No matched A/B has been run here.

- **`.env.sample` documents `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS`** and keeps the default at
  2048 (`366f6df`). Raising it to 8192 measured, on this host, 32k prefill
  2,133 → 2,366 tok/s (+10.9%) and TTFT 15.38 → 13.87 s (−9.8%), with the whole
  8k–128k curve flattening. It is offered as an opt-in knob rather than a
  default because the supporting observation is minutes, not hours. It is paid
  for out of the KV pool rather than the GPU budget: 8192 chunks raise peak
  activation to 1.27 GiB, which vLLM profiles before sizing the KV cache.

- **README prefill table now carries both chunk widths side by side**, each
  labelled with the configuration it was measured at (`366f6df`). They differ in
  rope config and KV target as well as chunk width, so only the 32k pair is a
  clean A/B.

- **`start.sh`'s FP8 warning dropped a stale speed claim** (`69f7b4c`). It cited
  the reference implementation's ~30% slower prefill and ~9% slower decode; the
  quality warning (a long-reasoning benchmark falling 6/6 → 2/6) stands.

- **README: `### FP8 KV cache (opt-in)` → `(default)`**, and the patch bullet's
  "Off by default" corrected (`69f7b4c`). Both contradicted the body text and
  the shipped `KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8`.

### Reverted

- **`KV_TARGET_GIB` 22 → 20 → 22 → 20.** Lowered in `554f295` on the theory that
  the watchdog kills were a memory problem, restored in `c79f765` once those two
  kills turned out to be a watchdog bug, then lowered again once a third server
  died on a genuine sustained decline. Both things were true: the watchdog fired
  on noise *and* the host margin at 22 is thin. The default is 20.

- **`MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS` default 2048 → 8192 → 2048.** Defaulted in
  `677f4ab`, backed out in `366f6df` and documented as an opt-in instead. See
  above for the measurements.

### Verified

- **The debounced watchdog correctly distinguished a real event from noise.** A
  third server died at 23:53 on a monotonic descent — 7,101 MiB to 5,726 MiB in
  9 seconds, still falling — and the trigger fired after 5 consecutive sub-floor
  samples. The per-sample near-floor logging captured the whole descent, which
  the old script could not have shown. Unlike the two earlier kills, the
  container's own cgroup was *growing* through this one (10,716 → 12,348 MiB),
  so the mechanism differs from the slow drift.

  The 10 s SIGTERM grace was not enough — `docker stop` escalated to SIGKILL and
  the exit code was still 137, so the shm-leak protection did not take effect.

### Known open

- Host `MemAvailable` has two unexplained behaviours: a slow decline under
  sustained long-context prefill, and at least one burst that consumed ~1.4 GiB
  in 9 seconds. `memwatch.sh` logs `MemAvailable`, `MemFree`, `SwapFree` and
  the container's cgroup usage; adding `Mapped`/`Cached`/`AnonPages` would let
  the next descent identify its own cause.
- The shipped default (262k, `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, FP8, 2048 chunks) has still not
  been benchmarked end to end.
- Whether the 6 GiB watchdog floor is the right threshold has never been
  examined; it was chosen during bring-up.
- `MEMWATCH_GRACE` (10 s) is too short for vLLM to shut down cleanly.
