Self-contained recipe for serving the `Mia-AiLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4`
checkpoint (99 GiB) from a single DGX Spark's 121 GiB unified memory, via vLLM
with the PLE table offloaded and memory-mapped. This is a **vision-language**
model: text, images and video all work out of the box (see below). Nothing here depends on the
2-node files it was derived from.

```
cp .env.sample .env        # edit IMAGE / HF_TOKEN if needed
./download.sh              # fetch the ~99 GiB checkpoint (resumable, sha256-verified)
./start.sh                 # ~10-12 min to /health; serves on :8888
./stop.sh                  # container + watchdog, graceful
```

`start.sh` never downloads anything — it resolves the checkpoint from the local
Hugging Face cache and fails fast if it is absent. Budget ~130 GiB of free disk:
99 GiB for the checkpoint plus the ~27 GiB packed PLE table built on first launch.

`./start.sh --no-launch` prints the derived memory budget and the docker
command without running anything. `./stop.sh` sends SIGTERM and waits up to
`STOP_TIMEOUT` (default 30 s) so vLLM can unlink its POSIX shared memory —
the container runs with `--ipc host`, so segments it leaves behind leak onto
the host's `/dev/shm` until reboot. `./stop.sh --force` skips the wait.

**Migration — the API binds to every interface again.** The API briefly
defaulted to loopback (`127.0.0.1`); it now binds `0.0.0.0` by default
(`BIND`) as it originally did. With no `API_KEY` / `--api-key` set, `start.sh`
prints a WARN listing the exposed interfaces — anything that can reach the
port can reach the model, so serve with a key or set `BIND=127.0.0.1` in
`.env` and reach the box through an ssh tunnel.

## Measured profile

`.env.sample` ships **262,144 context (YaRN off), MTP 3, `HOST_RESERVE_GIB=26`,
`KV_TARGET_GIB=20`, `KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8`, `MAMBA_SSM_CACHE_DTYPE=bfloat16`,
`MAX_NUM_SEQS=4`, `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=2048`**, with the V2 model runner
pinned through `EXTRA_DOCKER_ARGS`. For Spanish traffic, also swap the draft
vocabulary: `MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB=files/draft_vocab_es_en_code_65k.txt`
(see [Serving Spanish](#serving-spanish-65k-draft-vocab)).
Everything below was measured on this host on 2026-09-04; each row names the
configuration it came from, because the numbers move a lot between them.
Decode numbers are not in this table: they predate the 2026-09-05 optimisation
pass and are superseded by the [sparkDash sweep](#prefill-and-decode-measured-with-sparkdash)
below (48.7 tok/s single-stream prose, 162.9 aggregate at 8 streams).

| Configuration | KV pool | Prefill @400k | Needles 5/50/95% |
|---|---|---|---|
| 262k, `KV_TARGET_GIB=20`, BF16 | 21.28 GiB = 736,837 tok (2.81x a 262k req) | — | — |
| 512k YaRN, `KV_TARGET_GIB=20`, BF16 | 19.2 GiB = 704,558 tok (1.34x a 512k req) | 1,537 tok/s (TTFT 260.3 s) | 3/3 PASS |
| 512k YaRN, `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, BF16 | 796,196 tok (1.52x a 512k req) | 1,883 tok/s @32k | 12/14 (see FP8 section) |
| 512k YaRN, `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, FP8 | 22.2 GiB = 1,431,164 tok (2.73x a 512k req) | 1,495 tok/s (TTFT 267.7 s); 1,769 tok/s @32k | 15/20 (see FP8 section) |

The same profile at `KV_TARGET_GIB=16` and `MAX_NUM_SEQS=5` (262k,
`HOST_RESERVE_GIB=26`, FP8) was measured on 2026-09-05. The shipped wish is now
20, which this host clips to 16.67 GiB — see [Configuration](#configuration):

| | |
|---|---|
| GPU budget | GMU 0.780 = 94.87 GiB |
| Available KV cache | 16.46 GiB = **992,584 tokens** (3.79x a 262k request) |
| Time to `/health` | 10 min 51 s (checkpoint read from NVMe) |
| Host MemAvailable, 2 min after `/health` | 15.7 GiB (MemFree 5.1 GiB) |
| Host MemAvailable, 40 idle minutes | 15.5–16.4 GiB (MemFree ≥ 4.4 GiB) |
| Host MemAvailable after two ~90k prompts | 16.2 → 15.05 GiB after the first, 15.2 GiB 60 s after the second (min 14.9 during prefill; MemFree ≥ 3.5 GiB) |
| Host MemAvailable, five concurrent ~60k prompts | 14.9 → 14.57 GiB at +60 s (min 14.26 during; MemFree ≥ 3.24 GiB); 5/5 completed, no watchdog event |
| 2.5 h under the qwen-code harness (~38 requests, 19 of them 50–100k tokens, up to 3 concurrent) | 14.2–14.9 GiB between turns, min 12.8 GiB at 3 concurrent; driver 96.6 → 97.5 GiB in one step |
| `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` in `journalctl -k` | 0 across launch and all of the above |

The idle figure used to be quoted here as ~12.9 GiB; that came from a
2026-09-04 run — before the host-side cap existed, so `KV_TARGET_GIB=20` then
meant 20 GiB of KV rather than today's clipped 16.67 — and before the day's
co-tenants were on the box. See the safety
rules for why the number matters.

One honest gap: `KV_TARGET_GIB=20` is now measured end to end — ten launches,
the 1/2/4/8-stream decode sweep, needles 15/15 at 32k and a 45-minute soak on
2026-09-06 — but every one of those ran at **512k YaRN**, not at the shipped
262k native rope. The 262k row above is at BF16 and predates the `MADV_RANDOM`
mmap change. Short-context (32k) prefill is measured for both dtypes; see the
FP8 section.

`KV_TARGET_GIB` shipped as 22, then 20, until 2026-09-05. Both lost servers:
three on 2026-09-04. The rows above at 22 are real measurements, but the host
they were taken on had 6.9–8.8 GiB of `MemAvailable` left, against a 6 GiB
watchdog floor and a GPU driver that refuses allocations before that. The
budget is now capped from the host side (`HOST_RESERVE_GIB`, see
[Safety rules](#safety-rules)); the KV pool is whatever the cap leaves. The
shipped wish is 20 and this host clips it to 16.67 GiB, so 20 and 22 of actual
KV are no longer reachable through `KV_TARGET_GIB` alone; a pinned
`GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` still gets you there, with a warning.

### Prefill and decode, measured with sparkDash

Both sweeps below were measured with
[sparkDash](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash) against this server.
`bench/sweep.py` drives it one concurrency level at a time and reads vLLM's
own counters around each level, which is what makes the ms-per-step and
tokens-per-step columns below comparable across launches; `bench/mixed.py`
covers the decode-under-prefill case sparkDash has no mode for. The two
prefill columns are **not** a clean A/B — they differ in rope config and KV
target as well as chunk width — so each is labelled with what it was measured
at.

#### 2026-09-06: BF16 recurrent state and every verify width on a graph

Measured on 512k YaRN, MTP 3, FP8 KV, 2,048 chunks, `CUDAGRAPH_CAPTURE_SIZES=auto`,
`MAMBA_SSM_CACHE_DTYPE=bfloat16`, the V2 model runner pinned, and
**`MAX_NUM_SEQS=8`** — which is the one part of this row that `.env.sample`
does not ship, because every sweep here was short-context. Prose, 600 tokens,
three repeats per level, `bench/sweep.py`:

| streams | ms/engine step | tokens/step | aggregate | per stream |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 61.5 | 3.00 | **48.7 tok/s** | 48.7 tok/s |
| 2 | 74.3 | 2.83 | **74.6 tok/s** | 37.3 tok/s |
| 4 | 96.2 | 2.84 | **113.7 tok/s** | 28.4 tok/s |
| 8 | 131.0 | 2.81 | **162.9 tok/s** | 20.4 tok/s |

Two changes separate this from the 2026-09-05 row. `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8` with a FULL
decode graph at all eight verify widths (4 through 32) is what makes the
8-stream column reachable at all. BF16 recurrent state is worth **+8.5% at 8
streams** on its own, in a matched pair on the same launch config: 151.6 →
164.5 tok/s, step 141.4 → 130.4 ms, with per-position draft acceptance
unchanged within rounding (0.80/0.59/0.41 against 0.79/0.58/0.42) and needle
retrieval unchanged at 15/15.

**Speculative depth was swept properly here for the first time** (K=0/1/2/3 at
every stream count, FULL graphs throughout). K=3 wins at every concurrency,
K=2 ties it, K=1 loses 8–14% and K=0 loses 32–46%. There is no crossover, so
`MTP_K_SCHEDULE` has nothing to schedule. The full table is in the CHANGELOG.

#### 2026-09-11: structured (counting-stream) decode at MAX_NUM_SEQS=8

Same launch config as the 2026-09-06 row except `HOST_RESERVE_GIB=28` (at 26
the 8-width graph-capture spike trips the watchdog on this host — see
`.env.sample` under `MAX_NUM_SEQS`), measured with `bench/structured.py`:
a counting-style predictable stream, 400 completion tokens, temperature 0,
thinking off — the workload shape sparkDash's "structured" prompt type uses.
**Not comparable to the prose tables above**: near-deterministic continuation
is MTP's best case, so these read ~35% higher single-stream. They exist so
structured-prompt numbers published elsewhere can be compared like-for-like.

| streams | aggregate | per stream | TTFT |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **65.2 tok/s** | 67.7 tok/s | ~230 ms |
| 2 | **116.2 tok/s** | 60.7 tok/s | ~290 ms |
| 4 | **205.9 tok/s** | 53.9 tok/s | ~315 ms |
| 8 | **313.6 tok/s** | 42.8 tok/s | ~370–1,190 ms |

**Decode under a concurrent prefill** is the one place the shipped chunk width
hurts. With two streams decoding and one 64k prompt arriving, the gap between
their streamed chunks for the 34.5 s of that prefill is p50 1,057 ms /
p95 1,111 ms / p99 1,400 ms, against 78 ms on the quiet server. **Those are per
engine step, not per token**: vLLM emits one streamed chunk per step carrying
that step's accepted tokens (~2.7 here, measured), so per-token latency is
roughly a third of the figures above. The two streams together delivered 74
steps' worth of output inside the window — ~5.8 tok/s if acceptance holds at
its quiet-server value. That is one engine step per 2,048-token chunk, by
construction. Halving the chunk to 1,024 takes p95 to 666 ms and p99 to 674 ms
and raises in-window delivery to 139 steps (~9.3 tok/s), for 5.5% of prefill
throughput at 64k. It is
not the shipped default (see the CHANGELOG for why the bar was not met), but if
your traffic is long prompts arriving against live streams, measure it.

**Prefill on this configuration**, three sparkDash ladders on 2026-09-06 (one
at 256k), server warm:

| context | TTFT | prefill | 2026-09-05 | change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8k | 3.74 s | **2,200 tok/s** (2,155–2,238) | 1,764 | +24.7% |
| 16k | 7.13 s | **2,304 tok/s** (2,293–2,311) | 2,265 | +1.7% |
| 32k | 14.18 s | **2,314 tok/s** (2,305–2,324) | 2,265 | +2.2% |
| 64k | 29.05 s | **2,257 tok/s** (2,257–2,258) | 2,222 | +1.6% |
| 128k | 61.09 s | **2,146 tok/s** (2,144–2,148) | 2,110 | +1.7% |
| 256k | 134.89 s | **1,944 tok/s** | 1,913 | +1.6% |

**Prefill did not change; only the 8k row looks like it did.** Fit
`TTFT = tokens / rate + overhead` across 16k–128k and the per-token rate is
2,125 tok/s here against 2,089 on 2026-09-05 — **+1.7%**, with the same
−0.60 s intercept in both. Every row above 8k agrees with that. The 8k point
sits above the fit in *both* ladders, by 1.34 s in the 2026-09-05 run and
0.47 s here, because 8k runs first and pays the PLE page-cache warm-up; a
server that has been up for hours has mostly already paid it. Read the 8k row
as a statement about cache state, not about kernels.

BF16 recurrent state is the only serving change since 2026-09-05, and prefill
is within ~2% either way, so its effect here is not separable from run-to-run
variation — unlike decode, where it is worth +8.5% at 8 streams. Note the
64k and 128k rows reproduce to ±0.05% across the three ladders, so that ±2% is
a between-launch figure, not measurement noise.

#### 2026-09-05: after the decode optimisation pass

Measured on the shipped profile (512k YaRN, 2,048 chunks, `MAX_NUM_SEQS=4`,
MTP 3, FP8 KV, `KV_TARGET_GIB=20` → 16.18 GiB = 974,768 tokens) with
`CUDAGRAPH_CAPTURE_SIZES=auto`, the PLE gather prefetch, and reduced-vocabulary
drafting (`MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB`, 65,536 tokens) all active. The "before" columns are
the same rope config and chunk width, so decode is a matched pair; prefill
differs only in `KV_TARGET_GIB` (22 → 20), which does not affect prefill rate.

**Decode on prose**, by concurrent stream count:

| streams | TTFT | aggregate | per stream | before | change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 270 ms | **46.3 tok/s** | 46.3 tok/s | 36.9 | **+25.5%** |
| 2 | 466 ms | **73.0 tok/s** | 36.5 tok/s | 57.4 | +27.2% |
| 3 | 355 ms | **91.9 tok/s** | 31.2 tok/s | — | — |
| 4 | 346 ms | **108.1 tok/s** | 27.7 tok/s | 85.9 | +25.8% |

Almost all of that is the reduced draft vocabulary. The MTP drafter reads its
own 1.18 GiB BF16 `lm_head` once per draft step, three of the four `lm_head`
reads in an MTP-3 engine step; slicing it to 65,536 rows saves 2.61 GiB per
step, and decode here is close enough to the memory-bandwidth wall that bytes
removed convert almost one-for-one into time. Accuracy is unchanged — the
target model verifies every drafted token — measured at 250 MGSM problems per
language, English 94.8% vs 93.6% and Chinese 86.4% vs 86.4%. See the CHANGELOG
entry for the full method.

That win now ships as the default: `.env.sample` sets `MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB` to the
checked-in `files/draft_vocab_en_code_47k.txt` (47,172 ids, code-tuned, 99.58%
held-out coverage on host code+docs), and `start.sh` resolves relative paths
against the repo and warns when MTP runs with the full head. Empty the knob to
restore full-vocabulary drafting. One honest caveat: the shipped file was built
from host code and docs, not from the model's own output, so non-code traffic
(especially Chinese, where the measured 65k vocab covered only 50.6%) may draft
worse than the numbers above; correctness is unaffected, only speed.
Live A/B of the shipped file against the full head (sparkDash prose+code
sweep, S=1/2/4/8, three repeats) measured +13.1% mean across eight cells with
acceptance unchanged — full table in the CHANGELOG 2026-09-09 entry.

**Prefill**, same chunk width as the shipped column below:

| context | TTFT | prefill | before | change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8k | 4.67 s | **1,764 tok/s** | 1,646 | +7.2% |
| 16k | 7.25 s | **2,265 tok/s** | 2,052 | +10.4% |
| 32k | 14.49 s | **2,265 tok/s** | 2,073 | +9.3% |
| 64k | 29.52 s | **2,222 tok/s** | 2,037 | +9.1% |
| 128k | 62.15 s | **2,110 tok/s** | 1,945 | +8.5% |
| 256k | 137.03 s | **1,913 tok/s** | 1,791 | +6.8% |

The prefill gain is most likely the PLE page-fault prefetch rather than the
draft vocabulary, which does not touch prefill: the PLE row gather runs for
every prefilled token, so a 2,048-token chunk gathers 16 rows per token —
~32,768 of them — against the ~256 a 4-stream MTP-3 decode step gathers. That
gather is single-threaded and was taking each
missing 4 KiB page fault on its own; batching the reads with
`posix_fadvise(WILLNEED)` measured 13x on a cold 280-row gather in isolation and
only ~3% on decode, where there are too few faults per step for it to matter.
This was not isolated with an A/B, so read the attribution as inference from
the mechanism, not as a measurement.

These numbers came from one run each. The decode figures are content-dependent
for the reason given at the end of this section, and the `x3` TTFT below `x2`
is run-to-run noise.

**Prefill.** At the shipped 2,048-token chunk width throughput peaks around
32-64k and falls away with context. Raising `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS` to 8,192
flattens it from 16k out to 128k, because per-chunk overhead is amortised over
4x fewer chunks:

| context | shipped: 2,048 chunks (512k YaRN, `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`) | opt-in: 8,192 chunks (262k native, `KV_TARGET_GIB=20`) |
|---|---|---|
| 8k | 5.00 s · 1,646 tok/s | **3.69 s · 2,228 tok/s** |
| 16k | 8.00 s · 2,052 tok/s | **7.16 s · 2,293 tok/s** |
| 32k | 15.83 s · 2,073 tok/s | **13.87 s · 2,366 tok/s** |
| 64k | 32.20 s · 2,037 tok/s | **28.31 s · 2,316 tok/s** |
| 128k | 67.41 s · 1,945 tok/s | **58.88 s · 2,227 tok/s** |
| 256k | 146.40 s · 1,791 tok/s | not re-measured |

The one matched pair — same server, same kernel, only the chunk width changed —
is 32k: **2,133 → 2,366 tok/s (+10.9%), TTFT 15.38 → 13.87 s (−9.8%)**. The
rest of the right-hand column is one run each and should be read as indicative.

### Raising the prefill chunk width (opt-in)

**The 8,192 column is not the default.** If you want the faster prefill and
TTFT above, set it yourself:

```
MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=8192 ./start.sh     # one launch
```

or edit the line in `.env` to make it stick.

It is paid for out of the KV pool, not the GPU budget. 8,192 chunks raise peak
activation to 1.27 GiB, and vLLM profiles that *before* it sizes the KV cache,
so the pool absorbs it: 1,145,289 tokens measured at `KV_TARGET_GIB=20`,
still 4.37x a full 262k request. The best matched evidence for the size of that
trade is PR #2's own pair at `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, 1,282,724 → 1,249,637 tokens —
about **−2.6%** of pool for **+11%** prefill.

Host `MemAvailable` sat at 8.1-8.3 GiB idle and low-watered at 7.4 GiB across
the 8,192 sweep. It is offered as a knob rather than a default because the
supporting observation is minutes, not hours: if you serve long sessions near
the memory floor, measure it on your own workload before committing to it.

**Decode on prose** (2,048 chunks, 512k YaRN), by concurrent stream count.
These are the pre-2026-09-05 figures, kept because the tables above are stated
as deltas against them:

| streams | TTFT | aggregate | per stream |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 418 ms | 36.9 tok/s | 36.9 tok/s |
| 2 | 445 ms | 57.4 tok/s | 29.7 tok/s |
| 4 | 550 ms | 85.9 tok/s | 23.4 tok/s |

Decode speed on this model is **strongly content-dependent**, because MTP
speculative decoding accepts more drafts on predictable text. Measured
2026-09-06 on sparkDash prose: **2.80 tokens of a possible 4 per engine step**,
per-position acceptance **0.80 / 0.59 / 0.41** — 60% of drafted tokens
accepted. Quoting text back out of the context goes higher still; dense
technical prose sits lower. Treat single-stream decode as a range rather than
one number.

The figures quoted here until 2026-09-06 — acceptance length 2.1 of 4, per
position 0.65 / 0.33 / 0.14, and "~41 tok/s" as the *best* case — were taken
under PIECEWISE CUDA graphs with the full 248,320-token draft vocabulary. They
are superseded in both directions: acceptance is much higher, and ordinary
prose now measures 48.7 tok/s single-stream.


### Serving Spanish: 65k draft vocab

`MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB=files/draft_vocab_es_en_code_65k.txt` extends the shipped
47k English+code draft vocabulary to **65,536 rows** — the 47k file whole as
a floor (verified: 0 of the 47,172 ids missing) plus 668 MiB of Spanish
Wikipedia at natural frequencies, byte-fallback range pinned. It costs 9% of
the draft-head byte saving (0.31 vs 0.22 GiB lm_head, still 2.61 GiB/step
under MTP 3) and exists for one reason: **the 47k file covers only 64.4% of
Spanish output occurrences**, so Spanish drafting runs at ~0.9–1.0 accepted
tokens/draft where English prose runs ~1.8 (per-position 0.80/0.59/0.41). Correctness is identical either way —
rejection sampling rejects drafts outside the subset, never wrong output —
poor coverage only costs speed.

Measured on the contributor's host with an interleaved ABBA protocol
(five prompts per language, drift-cancelling): **Spanish 32.6 → 41.9 tok/s
(+28.6%), acceptance 0.94 → 1.56, English unchanged.** Re-verified here on
2026-09-14 against the live server after the merge: acceptance 1.53
accepted/draft aggregate (11,958/7,819 since relaunch) against the 0.94
baseline measured on the 47k file, English structured decode unchanged (67.9 / 114.4 tok/s at C1/C2
against the 65.2 / 116.2 reference), and the Spanish quality gate
(`bench/audit-spanish.py`: ~14k tokens across long-form essays, narrative,
Spanish-docstring code, JSON and a five-turn conversation) passes with **zero
replacement characters and zero dialect-drift markers**. The full method and
the two further findings it surfaced (per-mode sampling parameters and
benchmark-family comparability) are in
`docs/spanish-drafting-and-performance-2026-09-13.md`.

Use it when a meaningful share of your traffic is Spanish; otherwise stay on
the shipped 47k and keep the extra byte saving. Both files are built by
`files/build_draft_vocab.py` / `files/build_draft_vocab_extend.py`.

## Multimodal (images and video)

The checkpoint is multimodal (`is_multimodal: true`, `language_model_only:
false`, a 27-layer vision tower) and the launcher enables it by default —
nothing extra to configure. The vision tower is already counted in the
"weights on GPU" figure, so images and video cost no additional GPU budget.

Verified on this host 2026-09-04 against the running server:

| Modality | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Image | 336x336 PNG, three colour bands | named all three in order; 179 prompt tokens |
| Video | 4 s clip, 16 frames, one colour per second | named all four **in temporal order**; 376 prompt tokens |

Use the standard OpenAI content-part shapes — `image_url` and `video_url`,
either an `http(s)://` URL or a `data:` URI:

```
curl -s localhost:8888/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
 "model":"qwen3.8-flash-next","max_tokens":600,"temperature":0,
 "messages":[{"role":"user","content":[
   {"type":"image_url","image_url":{"url":"https://example.com/photo.jpg"}},
   {"type":"text","text":"Describe this image."}]}]}'
```

Three things to know before leaning on it:

- **MTP speculative decoding degrades on multimodal requests.** The draft model
  cannot take multimodal embeddings, so vLLM logs `using text-only draft inputs
  instead` and falls back for those requests. The answer is still correct — the
  target model sees the image — but decode runs closer to the non-speculative
  speed. Text-only requests are unaffected.
- **Video is token-hungry.** Frame count and resolution drive prompt length
  fast. At `YARN=1` with the shipped FP8 KV you have **2.16x** a full-length
  request in KV (measured 2026-09-06 on the running server), so two concurrent
  long video requests already contend; the 262k profile has far more headroom.
  The 1.34x quoted here before was a BF16-KV measurement.
- **Long video at 512k is untested here.** The tests above were long-text *or*
  short-multimodal, never both at once.

## Configuration

Precedence is **environment > `.env` > built-in default in `start.sh`**, so any
knob can be overridden per launch:

```
MAX_MODEL_LEN=65536 MTP_NUM_SPECULATIVE_TOKENS=0 ./start.sh
```

The safety-relevant knob is `HOST_RESERVE_GIB` (default 26): the GPU budget
is capped at `MemTotal − HOST_RESERVE_GIB` no matter what `KV_TARGET_GIB`
asks for, and `start.sh` prints "KV target X reduced to Y" when the cap binds.
`KV_TARGET_GIB` is a wish under that cap: the shipped 20 is clipped to
16.67 GiB here, ~1.13M FP8 tokens.
`HOST_SLACK_GIB` sizes the container cgroup cap (GPU budget + this); it bounds
host-side memory only and does not protect the host from the GPU side.

### Long context beyond 262k (YaRN)

The model's native context is 262,144. Going past it needs YaRN rope scaling,
which is off by default. The two lengths live side by side in `.env` and the
`YARN` flag alone picks which one is served:

```
YARN=0                     # 0 = native rope, 1 = YaRN
MAX_MODEL_LEN=262144       # served at YARN=0; cannot exceed native 262144
YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN=524288  # served at YARN=1; ignored entirely at YARN=0
```

So `YARN=1` is the only edit needed to go to 512k, and flipping it back to `0`
returns to 262k without touching anything else. For a single launch:
`YARN=1 ./start.sh`.

`start.sh` derives the scaling factor itself (`YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN / 262144`,
rounded up — 2.0 for 512k) and passes it to vLLM as a `--hf-overrides`
deep-merge into `text_config.rope_parameters`, which is the field this model
actually reads. The existing `mrope_section`, `rope_theta` and
`partial_rotary_factor` are preserved, so the attention path keeps the same
`MRotaryEmbedding` and mrope stays enabled.

512k fits with **no other change**: it needs 14.4 GiB of KV, well inside what
`KV_TARGET_GIB` provides at the shipped 20 or at 22, and the GPU budget and
cgroup cap are unchanged from 262k. Measured at `YARN=1`, BF16,
`KV_TARGET_GIB=20` (2026-09-04):

| | |
|---|---|
| Available KV cache | 19.2 GiB = **704,558 tokens** (1.34x a full 524,288 request) |
| Host MemAvailable idle | ~11.3 GiB |
| Output | coherent; MTP 3 and YaRN run together without incident |

At `KV_TARGET_GIB=22` with FP8 the same context gets 2.73x headroom instead of
1.34x — see [FP8 KV cache](#fp8-kv-cache-default). That 22 predates the
host-side cap; the shipped profile measures **2.16x** at 524k today.

400k prefill stress test (salted to defeat prefix caching, needles planted at
5% / 50% / 95% depth):

| | |
|---|---|
| Prompt | 400,062 tokens |
| TTFT (prefill) | 260.3 s = **1,537 tok/s** |
| Needle retrieval | **3/3 PASS**, including 95% depth |
| Host MemAvailable low-water | **10.97 GiB** (watchdog floor is 6 GiB) |
| Peak container RSS | 18.7 GiB of the 103 GiB cap |

Decode measured 40 tok/s on that run, but the answer is three codes copied out
of the context — MTP's best case, not typical decode speed.

| Setting | Result |
|---|---|
| `YARN=1` | serves `YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN`; `MAX_MODEL_LEN` is ignored (logged) |
| `YARN=0` with `MAX_MODEL_LEN` > 262144 | refused: tells you to set `YARN=1` |
| `YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN` > `YARN_CEILING_MODEL_LEN` (524288) | refused: above the validated ceiling |
| `YARN=1` with `YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN` at or below 262144 | warns, serves that length with native rope |
| 1M even with the ceiling raised | refused by the Step 2 budget check (cap 112 GiB vs 105 GiB ceiling) |

YaRN trades some short-context accuracy for the longer window, so leave it off
unless you need more than 262k. The 512k path is what every sparkDash sweep
above was measured on — decode, prefill and the 45-minute soak all ran at
`YARN=1`. It is the shipped **262k native-rope** profile that has not been
benchmarked end to end.

### Abliterated checkpoint (`ABLIT`)

`ABLIT=0` serves the stock Mia NVFP4 checkpoint. `ABLIT=1` serves the gated
Keys checkpoint
[`drowzeys/keys-Qwen3.8-flash-next-ablit-Mia-Single-Spark-only`](https://huggingface.co/drowzeys/keys-Qwen3.8-flash-next-ablit-Mia-Single-Spark-only):
the same Mia 34-shard layout with QSA `self_attn.o_proj` replaced at layers
15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43 and 47. MTP, PLE, routed experts and the chat
template stay stock. It is valid **only** on this recipe — do not use it with
other NVFP4 / FP8 / BF16 / GGUF trees.

Both checkpoints are **byte-for-byte the same size** (105,879,543,020 bytes of
safetensors): `o_proj` is a fixed-shape `F8_E4M3 [2560, 6144]` tensor, so
rewriting its values changes content, not length. 9 of the 37 shards differ —
exactly the ones holding the 9 edited layers. The download is still the full
snapshot, because Hugging Face's terms gate applies to the whole repo.

That Hugging Face repo is **gated**. Set `HF_TOKEN`, **Accept the terms on that
page**, then download the **full** snapshot (~99 GiB):

```
# 1. uncomment HF_TOKEN in .env
# 2. in the browser: accept the terms on the repo page
ABLIT=1 ./download.sh          # or set ABLIT=1 in .env first
ABLIT=1 ./start.sh
```

`HF_TOKEN` is required for `ABLIT=1`. A 403 means access has not been granted
yet — **Accept the terms on that page**, then retry with `HF_TOKEN` set. Stock
and ablit caches sit side by side; flipping `ABLIT` is the only switch. The
packed PLE table is reused from stock (those shards are unchanged), so
`start.sh` does not rebuild the 27 GiB table.

**The gate is a binding agreement, not a download button.** The checkpoint
ships its own `RESPONSIBLE_USE.md`, and requesting access means accepting it.
In summary: you must be 18 or older, you state your intended use on the request
form, and the terms prohibit sexual content involving minors, material
promoting self-harm or suicide, harassment, doxxing or fraud targeting real
people, anything illegal in your jurisdiction, and any use barred by the
upstream Qwen Community License. The weights are provided as-is with no
warranty and inherit their licence from the upstream Qwen base model. Read
`RESPONSIBLE_USE.md` and `COMPATIBILITY.md` in the repo before requesting
access — this paragraph is a summary, and the repo's own terms are what bind.

Safety refusals are removed in this checkpoint, which moves the guardrails onto
you: filtering, human review and access control are yours to supply. That
matters more here than on stock, because the shipped default serves the
network (`BIND=0.0.0.0`): without an `--api-key` — which `start.sh` warns
about — anything that can reach the port can reach an unfiltered model.

The abliteration splice is by **Keys (drowzeys)**, built on MiaAI Lab's
single-Spark NVFP4 recipe over Qwen/Alibaba's Qwen3.8-Flash-Next. See the
checkpoint's `CREDITS.md`, and [Credits](#credits) below.

### NVIDIA's official checkpoint (`TP1_MODEL_ID`)

This is optional. The stock Mia checkpoint stays the default, and nothing
changes unless you set `TP1_MODEL_ID`. To serve
[`nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4)
instead, download it:

```bash
./download.sh nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4
```

then set these three lines in `.env` and run `./start.sh`:

```bash
TP1_MODEL_ID=nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4
PLE_GIB=47.68
HOST_RESERVE_GIB=30
```

Without `PLE_GIB=47.68` the budget check counts the PLE table as GPU weights
and refuses to boot. Without `HOST_RESERVE_GIB=30` the CUDA-graph capture at
startup runs past the memory budget. If you turn MTP off
(`MTP_NUM_SPECULATIVE_TOKENS=0`), also set `MTP_WEIGHTS_GIB=2.34`.
`.env.sample` explains all of them.

**Trade-offs against the default checkpoint**, measured on one DGX Spark:

| | default (Mia) | NVIDIA |
|---|---|---|
| weights on the GPU | 71.8 GiB | 75.9 GiB |
| PLE table in host memory | 26.8 GiB | 47.7 GiB |
| disk (checkpoint + packed PLE table) | ~99 + 27 GiB | ~124 + 48 GiB |
| `HOST_RESERVE_GIB` it needs | 26 (the default) | 30 |
| KV pool at that reserve | ~975K tokens | ~545K-570K tokens |

At `HOST_RESERVE_GIB=26` the NVIDIA checkpoint peaked at 101.1 GiB of driver
memory against a 95.65 GiB budget during graph capture, with 12
`NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` in the kernel log. At 30 it peaked at 90.0 GiB with none.
30 also covers `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8` (measured).

Decode speed has not been measured against the default on equal settings.
NVIDIA keeps attention and the shared experts in BF16, so each token moves
more bytes, and decode is expected to be slower. Output quality has not been
compared here either; NVIDIA's model card has its own accuracy numbers. Use
this checkpoint when you want NVIDIA's own quantization. For one Spark, the
default checkpoint is the better fit.

The checkpoint is NVIDIA's own Model Optimizer
(v0.46.0) quantization of the same upstream `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next`, not a
community re-quant: mixed precision (MSE-calibrated NVFP4 on routed MoE
experts, BF16 kept on attention/shared-experts, FP8 MTP), 124 GiB rather than
the stock 99 GiB. Weights are unmodified NVIDIA output — this is a serving
compatibility layer, not a re-quantization or a merge of the two checkpoints.

It needed two fixes beyond pointing `TP1_MODEL_ID` at it, both because its
internal layout differs from the stock checkpoint this recipe was built
against:

- **PLE table format.** Stock's n-gram table is NVFP4-coded (`U8` 4-bit codes
  + a per-shard `F8_E4M3` scale). NVIDIA's is plain per-tensor `F8_E4M3`
  bytes with a single global `BF16` scale — verified against the checkpoint's
  own tensors (`shard_N.weight` dtype, no per-shard `weight_scale`).
  `build_ple_packed_table.py` now branches on the shard dtype; the packed
  table this produces is 47.68 GiB (not the stock 26.82 GiB — set `PLE_GIB`
  accordingly, see `.env.sample`). `tests/test_nvidia_ple.py` covers both
  builder paths plus a byte-exact sample check against the real downloaded
  checkpoint.
- **MTP MoE quantization.** NVIDIA's `hf_quant_config.json` declares the MTP
  draft model's routed experts under their own local layer index
  (`mtp.layers.0.mlp.experts`, `quant_algo: FP8_BLOCK_SCALES`, `group_size:
  128`), but `mtp.py`'s `remap_weight_names()` mounts those tensors at the
  model's global layer index (`mtp.layers.48...`, after the main model's own
  layers) without renumbering the quantization declaration to match, so it's
  never found. ModelOpt's config parsing also normalizes that declared
  algorithm to its own internal name, `FP8_PB_WO` (128x128 block-scaled FP8 —
  same layout `ModelOptFp8PbWoLinearMethod` already handles for Linear
  layers, confirmed against this checkpoint's tensors: `down_proj` weight
  `[2560, 640]` F8_E4M3, `weight_scale_inv` `[20, 5]` BF16), for which
  `get_quant_method` had no `RoutedExperts` branch at all. `patch_modelopt_mxfp8.py`
  now bridges the local/global index (MTP always has exactly one local
  layer) and routes `FP8_PB_WO` MoE experts to vLLM's native (non-ModelOpt)
  `Fp8MoEMethod`/`Fp8Config`, the same block-scaled implementation DeepSeek-V3
  checkpoints use. `tests/test_nvidia_mtp.py` covers the index bridging.

Verified on a single DGX Spark (GB10, 121 GiB): clean boot at the shipped
profile (262144 context, MTP 3, FP8 KV, `CUDAGRAPH_MODE=FULL_DECODE_ONLY`),
correct Korean generation and `tool_calls` output, ~25 tok/s end-to-end
(prefill included) on a short single-stream request versus ~18 tok/s with MTP
off on the same host. That is a spot check, not a sparkDash sweep — the
prefill/decode tables above are stock-checkpoint numbers and do not apply
here; NVIDIA's own model card has the accuracy comparison against `Qwen3.8-27B`
and other baselines.

### Reasoning is on by default

This build reasons before answering, and `start.sh` passes
`--reasoning-parser qwen3`, so the thinking block arrives in a separate
`reasoning` field rather than inside `content`. The chat template enables it
whenever the flag is unset:

```jinja
{%- if enable_thinking is undefined or enable_thinking is true %}
```

Turn it off **per request** — no restart, so reasoning and non-reasoning
traffic can share one server:

```json
{"model":"qwen3.8-flash-next",
 "chat_template_kwargs":{"enable_thinking":false},
 "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is 17*23? One line."}]}
```

Measured on this host:

| | default | `enable_thinking: false` |
|---|---|---|
| reasoning tokens | 41 | **0** |
| completion tokens | 47 | **12** |
| `content` | `"\n\n391"` | `"17 * 23 = 391"` |

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **It is why `content` can come back empty.** With a small `max_tokens` the
  reply is often still inside its reasoning. Budget ~400+ tokens, or disable
  thinking. This is not a bug — see the sanity test above.
- **It dominates latency on simple work.** Reasoning ran to 4,841 tokens on the
  hardest task in our suite. For extraction, classification or short factual
  answers, disabling it is a large win; leave it on for anything that needs
  actual multi-step reasoning.

### FP8 KV cache (default)

`KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8` roughly doubles the KV pool by storing the main KV in
fp8-e4m3. The QSA Triton kernels cast FP8 tiles to BF16 for the tensor-core
dots and apply the per-tensor K/V scales once, to the score and the output
accumulator. **This is the shipped default**, on the strength of the
measurements below.

```
KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8    # ~2x KV pool, enables a 1M context (default)
KV_CACHE_DTYPE=auto   # BF16 KV, if you would rather not take the trade
```

Measured on this host 2026-09-04, identical prompts, `YARN=1`,
`KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, idle server:

All rows below are at matched settings (`KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, 512k YaRN) unless
noted. KV pool varies a little between restarts, so a range is given.

| | BF16 | FP8 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| KV pool | 779,671–796,196 tok | **1,431,164–1,502,014 tok** | **~1.8–1.9x** |
| Concurrency @ 524,288 | 1.49–1.52x | **2.73–2.86x** | ~+85% |
| Prefill @400k | 1,537 tok/s | 1,495 tok/s | −2.7% |
| Prefill @32k (2 runs each) | 1,883 tok/s | 1,769 tok/s | −6.1% |
| Reasoning suite (11 tasks) | **11/11** | **11/11** | same |
| Needle miss rate @32k | 2/14 (14%) | 5/20 (25%) | p=0.67, **n.s.** |

Only the 12 full-attention layers shrink (~84% of bytes/token); the QSA
side/compressor caches stay BF16, which is why the gain is ~1.85x rather than
2x, and why `KV_MULT` in `start.sh` is 0.58 rather than 0.5.

**The short-context penalty has since been removed.** The original patch
dequantised each tile with vLLM's `_cast_kv_tile`, which materialises an FP32
tile (`(data.to(tl.float32) * scale).to(Q.dtype)`), and halved `block_n` to
keep that inside GB10's shared-memory budget. That cost more on a short kernel
than a long one: −6.1% at 32k versus −2.7% at 400k, in the rows above.

Hoisting the per-tensor scales outside the dots removes the FP32 tile, so FP8
runs at the same `block_n` as BF16. The scales are scalars, so this is exact
before rounding: `(Q·K)·k_scale` for the score, and `v_scale` on the normalised
output, which factors cleanly through the split-K LSE merge. It is also
slightly *more* accurate than dequantising first — FP8→BF16 is exact, whereas
rounding `scale × fp8` into BF16's 8-bit mantissa is not.

Measured by [@lidaiqing](https://github.com/lidaiqing) on this host (#2), FP8
before vs after the hoist, at matched settings:

| | before | after | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prefill @32k | 1,827 tok/s | 1,942 tok/s | **+6.3%** |
| Decode, 1 stream | 24.06 tok/s | 23.36 tok/s | −2.9% |
| Decode, 4 streams | 56.44 tok/s | 60.91 tok/s | +7.9% |
| Decode, 8 streams | 60.16 tok/s | 60.43 tok/s | +0.4% |
| Sparse QSA kernel, 512 rows | 2.984 ms | 1.772 ms | **−40.6%** |
| Block selector kernel | 0.1392 ms | 0.1008 ms | −27.6% |

The kernel is 40% faster in isolation but attention is not the bottleneck at
these settings, so end-to-end decode barely moves; the win that survives is
short-context prefill. Single-stream decode is within this model's
content-dependent MTP variance. On identical tensors the maximum
sparse-attention error was 1.53e-5 (one BF16 ULP) and the BF16 path was
bit-identical, as the algebra predicts.

**On quality.** Both dtypes score 11/11 on the reasoning suite
(4 multi-step short tasks, 4 long chain-of-thought up to ~4,800 reasoning
tokens, 3 tasks combining three facts from a ~100k-token context). Both max it
out, so the honest reading is *no gross regression at n=11* — enough to rule
out the 6/6 → 2/6 collapse the reference measured, not enough to detect finer
drift. A suite everything passes cannot rank anything.

**A caution about needle tests on this model.** The 95%-depth needle at 32k is
flaky *regardless of KV dtype*: BF16 missed it 2/14 times, FP8 5/20, which
Fisher's exact test cannot distinguish (p=0.67). The two shallower needles were
found 34/34 times in both. So a single needle run is weak evidence here — an
isolated PASS or FAIL at 95% depth says little, and comparisons need matched
sample counts on both sides. The 3/3 results quoted elsewhere in this README
are single samples and should be read with that in mind.

**A caveat before trusting these numbers: quality is not settled.** Needle retrieval passing at 5/50/95% depth shows the
scales and dequantisation are broadly right, and short factual/arithmetic
answers were correct. It does **not** clear the failure mode that matters: the
reference measured a long-reasoning benchmark falling from **6/6 to 2/6** with
FP8 KV. This is sparse attention — quantised keys perturb which blocks the
indexer selects, not merely the attention output — so degradation can appear
as fluent, plausible, wrong reasoning while needles still pass. No
long-reasoning A/B has been run on this host, and the scale hoist has not
changed that — its one-BF16-ULP bound is a numerical result, not a quality
one. Treat FP8 as a capacity trade for workloads you have validated
yourself.

### BF16 recurrent state (default)

`MAMBA_SSM_CACHE_DTYPE=bfloat16` overrides the checkpoint's
`mamba_ssm_dtype = float32` for the GDN recurrent state. The fused kernel
accepts it (`FUSED_GDN_STATE_DTYPES = (float32, bfloat16)`), and vLLM says so
at startup:

```
config.py:799 WARNING  Qwen3.5 model specifies mamba_ssm_dtype='float32' in its config,
              but --mamba-ssm-cache-dtype='bfloat16' was passed. Using the user-specified value.
interface.py:915  Setting attention block size to 1664 tokens   (3200 at float32)
```

The state is pure per-step traffic — roughly 0.23 GB per sequence read and
written every engine step — so halving it converts almost directly into step
time on a machine this close to the bandwidth wall. Halving the mamba page also
lets vLLM pick a 1,664-token attention block instead of 3,200, which doubles
prefix-cache granularity for multi-turn traffic.

Measured 2026-09-06 (512k YaRN, MTP 3, FP8 KV, `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8`, prose, three
repeats):

| | float32 (checkpoint) | bfloat16 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| decode @ 1 stream | 44.6 tok/s | 47.6 tok/s | +6.8% |
| decode @ 8 streams | 151.6 tok/s | **164.5 tok/s** | **+8.5%** |
| engine step @ 8 streams | 141.4 ms | 130.4 ms | −7.8% |
| tokens per step @ 8 streams | 2.80 | 2.80 | unchanged |
| attention block | 3,200 tok | 1,664 tok | halved |
| needles @32k, 5 runs | 15/15 | **15/15** | unchanged |

Only the 8-stream row clears the ±5%-in-all-three-repeats bar this host uses;
the others are positive but inside the noise floor.

**This is a precision change, so read the quality evidence before trusting it.**
Needle retrieval at 32k is identical to float32 across five runs at 5%, 50% and
95% depth, and a 4-turn continuation — the case that would expose a recurrence
degrading as it is carried forward — produces a final summary that recalls every
element of the conversation in both dtypes. That is the same bar the FP8 KV
default was held to, and it is one night's evidence rather than a graded task
eval. Set `MAMBA_SSM_CACHE_DTYPE=` empty to go back to the checkpoint's
float32.

### PLE mmap access pattern

The packed PLE table is advised `MADV_RANDOM` (in `patch_ple_offload.py`).
Without it the kernel faults in a ~64 KiB window to serve each 90-byte row
lookup. Measured on this host:

| | default mmap | `MADV_RANDOM` |
|---|---|---|
| Disk read per decoded token | ~1,366 KiB | **57 KiB** (−24x) |
| Host MemAvailable | ~10.9 GiB | **~12.95 GiB** |

Decode speed did not change measurably — decode was never disk-*throughput*
bound (1.4 MiB/token at ~26 tok/s, the rate at the time, is only ~36 MB/s). The real win is the
~2 GiB of unified memory no longer wasted on readahead that is thrown away,
which is what funds the KV pool `KV_TARGET_GIB` asks for.

## Unattended operation

The repo ships a supervisor that closes the detect → stop → recover loop the
base launcher leaves open: the container has **no docker `--restart`**
(deliberately — a docker-restarted container comes back *unwatched*, with
memwatch dead and stale shm). `scripts/supervise.sh` is the single state
machine: it keeps the container up, keeps memwatch up, health-probes once a
minute (5 consecutive failures → emergency stop → relaunch with backoff), and
holds a circuit breaker (3 emergencies in 2 h → OPEN, alert-only until a human
re-arms). Its state survives in `logs/supervisor.state`; the breaker resets on
host reboot.

Install (all USER units, exact commands):

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp systemd/qwen38-flash-supervisor.service \
   systemd/qwen38-flash-maintenance.service \
   systemd/qwen38-flash-maintenance.timer \

systemctl --user enable --now qwen38-flash-maintenance.timer
systemctl --user enable --now qwen38-flash-heartbeat.timer
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"     # user units start at boot without a login
```

The units assume the checkout lives at `~/qwen38-flash-next` (the `%h`
expansion). If it does not, adjust the `WorkingDirectory=` and `ExecStart=`
paths in the copied files to your checkout. `systemd-analyze verify` reports
"not executable / No such file or directory" solely because of that path
mismatch before editing; the unit files themselves are valid.

What you get:

- **`qwen38-flash-supervisor.service`** — the loop, `Restart=on-failure` (safe:
  the breaker state lives in the state file, not in systemd). `OnFailure=`
  fires `alert.sh`.
- **`qwen38-flash-maintenance.timer`** — weekly graceful relaunch (Sun 04:00):
  drains in-flight requests via `vllm:num_requests_running` (up to
  `MAINT_DRAIN_S`, default 600 s), restarts, `smoke-test.sh`, then releases the
  `logs/stopping` handshake flag. The slow per-request memory growth (2–3 GiB,
  never returned) is the reason: it converts a known maintenance item into an
  unscheduled outage otherwise.
- **`qwen38-flash-heartbeat.timer`** — daily unconditional heartbeat: uptime,
  restart count, `MemAvailable`, disk free. Unconditional on purpose: silence
  reads as "running".
- **`alert.sh`** — generic webhook (`ALERT_WEBHOOK` in `.env`; payload
  `{hostname,timestamp,message,container,mem_available}`; identical messages
  collapse to one per 15 min). Example URLs: ntfy (`https://ntfy.sh/<topic>`)
  or a telegram-bridge webhook. No-op with a WARN when unset — out-of-the-box
  stays silent-safe. A deliberately failing alert proves the path works:
  `ALERT_WEBHOOK=http://127.0.0.1:1 ./scripts/alert.sh test`.
- The supervisor warns at most once/hour if `comfy-h3.service` is active
  (it steals the API port), cleans leaked `/dev/shm` segments between cycles
  (only when no vLLM/sglang container runs), and rotates the memwatch log
  (copy-truncate at 10 MB) plus prunes `logs/archive/` to the newest 20 sets.

Host steps (documented, not automated — no sudo in-repo):

- `loginctl enable-linger <user>` (above).
- Verify docker is enabled: `systemctl is-enabled docker`.
- `sudo systemctl disable --now comfy-h3.service` — a reboot with it enabled
  means the server cannot take its port.
- Disable unattended-upgrades' automatic reboot: remove
  `Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot` from `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`
  (an auto-reboot at 02:00 with no linger = down until morning). Pin the NVIDIA
  driver so a bump under a running server is not a forced outage.
- NTP on: `timedatectl set-ntp true` (log correlation across
  memwatch/journal/archives is worthless without synced clocks).

**Maintenance / stop handshake:** `stop.sh` and the maintenance wrapper signal
the supervisor through a flag file (`logs/stopping`). While that file exists
the supervisor waits instead of relaunching (a crash between stop and healthy
leaves the flag in place — correct: the human gets the alert, and the next
supervisor tick adopts whatever is running). The flag does not pin the box
down forever: a reboot clears it, and the supervisor reclaims a flag older
than `STOPPING_MAX_AGE_S` (default 2 h, far longer than any maintenance
window) with an alert, so an abandoned maintenance cannot turn into a
permanent outage. Manual stops for real maintenance: `./stop.sh` then `touch
logs/stopping` (or run `maintenance-relaunch.sh` directly, which does the
whole window).

**Important:** the supervisor treats a >2 h old flag (or any flag after a
reboot) as abandoned and **auto-relaunches**. For planned downtime approaching
2 h, or any maintenance that includes a reboot, stop the supervisor unit
itself so it cannot act on your behalf:

```
systemctl --user stop qwen38-flash-supervisor
# … maintenance …
systemctl --user start qwen38-flash-supervisor
```

(The maintenance and heartbeat timers are harmless while the supervisor is
stopped — the maintenance wrapper would fail its smoke test into an alert, so
stop `qwen38-flash-maintenance.timer` too if the machine will be off across a
Sunday 04:00.)

**Re-arming the breaker:** the circuit breaker is file-backed
(`logs/supervisor.state`). To re-arm after a genuine human fix:
`rm -f logs/stopping logs/supervisor.state` — or reboot the host
(`BREAKER_RESET_ON_BOOT=1` default: a reboot is a human's hand on the box, and
it also clears a stale `logs/stopping`).

**Alert negative-test:** set `ALERT_WEBHOOK` to an unroutable URL once and
confirm the failure is visible in `logs/alert.log` — that is the intended way
to prove the path works.

## Safety rules

Each of these cost a hard host hang or a dead server during bring-up.

- **Budget the GPU from the host side.** vLLM detects this GPU as integrated
  and treats host `MemAvailable` — page cache included — as free GPU memory,
  then fills the GPU side to exactly `GMU × MemTotal`. Nothing in vLLM keeps
  anything back for the host. `start.sh` therefore caps the budget at
  `MemTotal − HOST_RESERVE_GIB` (26 GiB by default) and derives the KV pool
  from the remainder. What the reserve has to hold, measured here: other
  containers and sessions ~7 GiB (`start.sh` prints the live figure as "host
  footprint now" and warns above 9), vLLM's own host-side processes ~6, the PLE
  page cache that keeps decode off NVMe ≥6, free pages the NVIDIA driver needs
  to allocate at all ≥3, and 2–3 GiB of per-request growth (below). The page
  cache is not spare memory.
- **Keep host `MemAvailable` at or above ~10 GiB under load.** Exhausting the
  unified pool hangs the kernel with no OOM kill and no logs; the driver starts
  refusing allocations (`NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` in `journalctl -k`, which works
  without sudo) well before that, at `MemFree` ~3 GiB.
- **`comfy-h3.service` must stay disabled.** It polls `127.0.0.1:8888` and
  launches ComfyUI (a GPU co-tenant) as soon as anything answers there.
  `start.sh` refuses port 8888 while that service is active.
- **Never set `PLE_OFFLOAD=false` at TP=1** — 99 GiB through UVM hangs the host.
- **The stock QSA backend refuses FP8 KV** (`supported_kv_cache_dtypes =
  ["auto","bfloat16"]`). `patch_qsa_fp8_kv.py` in this repo adds it; without
  that patch `KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8` cannot work, and reading a quantised cache
  as BF16 would produce silent garbage rather than an error.
- **Do not raise `YARN_CEILING_MODEL_LEN` past 524288 at BF16.** A 1M context
  needs ~28.8 GiB of KV, driving the container cap to 112 GiB against a 105 GiB
  hard ceiling; `start.sh` refuses it at two independent checks. With
  `KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8` a 1M request needs only ~16.7 GiB and the budget does
  fit — but 1M has **never been run on this host**, at either dtype. Raising
  the ceiling means you are the one testing it.
- `docker --memory` does not bound GPU allocations on GB10, only host-side
  memory. vLLM's `--gpu-memory-utilization` is what bounds the GPU.
- **Kernel VM tunables.** The box ships with `vm.min_free_kbytes=45155` and
  `vm.watermark_scale_factor=10`: a 44 MB free-page floor and reclaim that
  starts at 0.1 %. `files/sysctl-spark3.conf` holds the values a sibling Spark
  measured six crash-free bring-ups with; `start.sh` warns when the box is at
  the defaults. They are **not applied** by anything in this repo, and the
  file's header explains why the watchdog floor must be re-derived before
  they are: at those values the same physical state reads roughly 11–15 GiB
  lower in `MemAvailable` (computed from the kernel's watermark formula, not
  measured here).

### What happened on 2026-09-04

Three servers died in one evening at `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, all under a qwen-code
agent harness (up to five agents, 370 requests averaging 72k input tokens over
five hours, pointed at `127.0.0.1:8888`). The budget arithmetic left 20.7 GiB
of the 121.6 GiB pool for everything that is not the GPU, against the ≥22 GiB
listed above. `sar` shows the first server spending its last hour at 6.3–6.6
GiB of `MemAvailable`; the kernel log shows the driver refusing four
allocations in the eight seconds before the second death; the watchdog's own
log shows the third at `MemFree` 2.6 GiB. The earlier reading of the first two
deaths as watchdog noise was wrong: the debounce added that day is a good
change and does not touch the cause.

The growth is real and permanent. Each new largest request (70–95k tokens)
grows driver-side memory by ~2 GiB — workspaces the startup profile never
touched, held by PyTorch's caching allocator, which this build only releases
under pressure inside the model loader, never while serving. In the watchdog
log it appears as the container cgroup going *down* (PLE page cache evicted)
while `MemAvailable` goes down and `MemFree` stays flat; the new `driver`
column makes it visible directly. The reserve is sized to absorb it.

### Watchdog

`files/memwatch.sh` runs alongside the container, polls `/proc/meminfo` every
second, and stops the container on either of two floors, each debounced over
**5 consecutive** samples (a lone excursion logs `recovered after N sub-floor
sample(s)` and resets the counter — `MemAvailable` moves ~107 MiB between
samples here, with excursions past 1 GiB):

- `MemAvailable < MEMWATCH_MIN_GIB` (default 6): the page cache is gone.
- `MemFree < MEMWATCH_MIN_FREE_GIB` (default 2) **while** `MemAvailable <
  MEMWATCH_FREE_GATE_GIB` (default 10): the driver's failure point. The gate
  is not optional. With the stock watermarks `MemFree` legitimately sits near
  zero whenever the page cache is full of reclaimable data — measured during
  weight loading: `MemFree` 0.9 GiB, `MemAvailable` 32 GiB, zero driver
  errors — and an ungated version of this trigger killed a healthy launch.

The MemFree floor has an optional relief step, `MEMWATCH_RELIEF=drop_caches`
(default `off`; `profiles/spark1-best.env` turns it on). At the stock kernel
watermarks kswapd reclaims page cache only near 150 MiB free, so the floor
can fire while GiBs of clean page cache are still resident: on 2026-09-23
08:36 it stopped spark1 at `MemFree` 1.2 GiB and `MemAvailable` 8.3 GiB with
5.7 GiB cached. With relief on, after `MEMWATCH_RELIEF_AT` (2) sub-floor
samples, and when at least `MEMWATCH_RELIEF_MIN_GIB` (1) of file cache is
reclaimable, the watchdog runs `echo 1 | sudo -n tee
/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` under `timeout -k 2 10`. Then it logs `MemFree`,
`MemAvailable` and the reclaimable cache before and after, resets the
counter, and stops only if the floor holds for 5 more samples. It does this
at most once per `MEMWATCH_RELIEF_INTERVAL` (60) seconds. A failed relief
(no sudo rule) is logged once and relief stays off for that run. The relief
runs in the background: the watchdog waits at most 1 s for it, then both
floors and the `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` check keep sampling, and the counter
resets when the relief ends. No signal stops the kernel's drop_caches scan,
so a relief still running 14 s after its start is logged as stuck and relief
stays off for that run. drop_caches skips mapped pages, so the PLE table
rows the gather reads through its memmap stay in memory. The
`MemAvailable` floor has no relief. The step needs a sudoers rule; the
header of `files/memwatch.sh` has it. Raising `vm.watermark_scale_factor` is
not the alternative: it lowers `MemAvailable` by the watermark size, and the
`MemAvailable` floor then fires. `bash tests/test_memwatch_relief.sh` runs
the hermetic tests.

Every 10 s it counts `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` lines in `journalctl -k` and logs any
non-zero count. Read it together with `MemAvailable`: a handful during
startup, when the driver takes the weights and then the KV pool in two large
bursts while `MemFree` is transiently ~1 GiB under the page cache from the
checkpoint read, is the driver bouncing off free pages and retrying (measured
2026-09-05 08:15–08:16: five of them at `MemAvailable` 17–34 GiB, launch
succeeded; the launch seven hours earlier had none — it depends on where
kswapd is when the burst lands). The fatal pattern is the same line with
`MemAvailable` under ~10 GiB, when there is no cache left to reclaim. The
timeline
(every 5 s, every sample once within 1 GiB of a floor) carries `avail`,
`free`, `swapfree`, the container cgroup, `cached`, `anon`, `shmem`, `mapped`,
`sunreclaim` and the derived `driver` figure (`MemTotal − MemFree − Buffers −
Cached − AnonPages − Slab − PageTables − KernelStack`: memory outside page
cache, anon and cgroup accounting, i.e. taken through the NVIDIA driver;
95.5 GiB at idle here against a 94.87 GiB budget).

Before stopping it archives `docker logs --tail 3000` and a copy of its own
log to `logs/archive/<container>-<timestamp>-{container,memwatch}.log`, then
sends SIGTERM with a 30 s grace period (`MEMWATCH_GRACE`) and falls back to
SIGKILL, so vLLM can unlink its POSIX shared memory — a hard kill leaks those
segments onto the host's `/dev/shm` until reboot, because the container runs
with `--ipc host`. vLLM does not honour SIGTERM while still loading weights;
a stop in that phase ends in the SIGKILL. `start.sh` archives the previous
container and watchdog logs the same way before it relaunches.

Two 2026-09-09 additions tie the watchdog into the supervisor loop:

- **Emergency marker + alert.** The emergency stop path now writes
  `WATCHDOG EMERGENCY STOP <reason>` as its last log line and calls
  `scripts/alert.sh` (a no-op when `ALERT_WEBHOOK` is unset). Clean
  `stop.sh` paths produce neither, so the supervisor can tell an emergency
  from a human stop. Memwatch never restarts the container — the supervisor
  owns relaunches.
- **`LEAK TREND` line.** Over the first 10 minutes it records the `driver`
  figure as a baseline; once the run's `driver` has grown 4 GiB above it
  (`MEMWATCH_TREND_GIB`), it logs a `LEAK TREND` line once per day. This is
  the documented 2–3 GiB per-request growth the CUDA caching allocator never
  returns showing up as a trend; the response is the scheduled maintenance
  relaunch, not a new alarm.
- Memwatch log rotation is copy-truncate (safe with the fd memwatch keeps
  open): `scripts/memwatch-rotate.sh` copies past-10 MB and truncates, and
  prunes `logs/archive/` to the newest 20 sets.

## Sanity test

```
curl -s localhost:8888/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  ${API_KEY:+-H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"} -d '{
 "model":"qwen3.8-flash-next","temperature":0,"max_tokens":400,
 "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"In one sentence, what is a DGX Spark?"}]}' \
 | python3 -c "
import json,sys
m=json.load(sys.stdin)['choices'][0]['message']
print('reasoning:', (m.get('reasoning') or '')[:200])
print('content  :', m.get('content'))"
```

This build emits reasoning **before** the answer, in a `reasoning` field rather
than `content`. Budget at least ~400 `max_tokens`: at 200 the reply is still
inside its reasoning, so `content` comes back empty on a perfectly healthy
server. Gibberish in either field means the PLE path has regressed (bf16 IPC
buffer or missing quant scales) — see the patch notes below. If `--api-key` is
set (the shipped default), set `API_KEY` in the shell first or the call 401s;
`scripts/smoke-test.sh` and the bench scripts read it from `.env` themselves.

## Layout

- `download.sh` — fetches the checkpoint into the Hugging Face cache
  (resumable; honours `HF_TOKEN` for gated repos; sha256-verifies every LFS
  blob against the paginated HF tree manifest unless `VERIFY_SHA256=0`).
  `ABLIT=1` downloads the full Keys ablit snapshot after you accept the Hugging
  Face terms. Uses the host's `huggingface_hub` if present, otherwise the
  container image.
- `start.sh` — launcher: derives the GPU budget from live memory under the
  `HOST_RESERVE_GIB` cap, builds the packed PLE table on first run,
  regenerates the patched vLLM files, archives the previous run's logs, starts
  the container and `files/memwatch.sh`, waits for `/health` with a heartbeat
  and a `READY_TIMEOUT_S` deadline.
- `stop.sh` — stops the watchdog, then the container (gracefully by default);
  reports leftover `/dev/shm` segments without deleting them.
- `scripts/smoke-test.sh` — per-launch verification: health, model metadata,
  coherent generation, temperature-0 determinism (WARN-only), decode speed
  (≥15 tok/s), a tool-call round-trip (settles `qwen3_coder` vs `qwen3_xml`),
  and `/metrics`.
- `scripts/supervise.sh` + `systemd/qwen38-flash-*.service/timer` — the 24/7
  supervisor, weekly maintenance relaunch, daily heartbeat, and `OnFailure=`
  alert target (see [Unattended operation](#unattended-operation)).
- `scripts/health-probe.sh` — stateless single-shot probe (health +
  generation, `completion_tokens > 0`) used by the supervisor.
- `scripts/alert.sh` — generic webhook POST (`ALERT_WEBHOOK`), rate-limited,
  never changes control flow on failure.
- `scripts/memwatch-rotate.sh` — copy-truncates the memwatch log at 10 MB and
  prunes `logs/archive/` to the newest 20 sets.
- `files/patch_ple_layer.py`, `files/patch_modelopt_mxfp8.py`,
  `files/patch_ple_offload.py` — generators that rewrite the patched vLLM
  files from pristine `*.orig` / `orig/` copies on **every** launch. Those
  copies are not in the repo — `start.sh` extracts them from the image on
  first run. Edit the generators; edits to the generated files are overwritten.
- `files/build_ple_packed_table.py` — one-time packed PLE table builder
  (27 GiB output under `~/.cache/vllm/ple_cache/`, memory-mapped at runtime).
- `files/sysctl-spark3.conf` — recommended kernel VM tunables, not applied by
  anything here; read its header first.

- `bench/sweep.py` — decode sweep. Submits one
  [sparkDash](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash) job per concurrency level
  and snapshots `/metrics` around each, so every level also yields ms per
  engine step, tokens per step and per-position draft acceptance, plus host
  memory minima and the `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` count for that level.
- `bench/mixed.py` — decode under a concurrent prefill: two streams decoding
  when a ~64k prompt arrives, reporting the p95/p99 gap between their streamed
  chunks (one per engine step, ~2.7 tokens each) inside the prefill window. sparkDash has no mode for this shape.
- `bench/audit-spanish.py` — Spanish quality gate: long-form, multi-turn and
  accent-heavy generations scored per paragraph for replacement characters
  (broken byte-fallback), neighbouring-dialect markers (asturiano/gallego/
  catalán/portugués) and incorrect-spelling forms. Exits non-zero on any
  failure. Reads `PORT`/`SERVED_MODEL_NAME`/`API_KEY` from the environment,
  falling back to `.env`'s `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS --api-key`.
- `bench/structured.py` — sparkDash-free structured (counting-stream)
  concurrent decode bench: N streams started together, 400 completion tokens,
  temperature 0, thinking off. Numbers are MTP's best case (~35% above prose)
  and exist so structured-prompt numbers published elsewhere can be compared
  like-for-like. Same env/`.env` auth as `audit-spanish.py`.
- `bench/structured-protocol.py` — protocol-shape structured bench (the
  structured workload over realistic request shapes).
- `bench/verify-smoke.py` — quick speculative-decode acceptance check:
  reads `spec_decode_num_accepted_tokens_per_pos_total` deltas from
  `/metrics` around a few targeted generations.

The published prefill and decode numbers were measured with sparkDash, driven
by those two scripts. Both need an idle server: the counter deltas and
sparkDash's own figures include any other traffic on the port.

## What is patched and why

- **PLE layer** (`patch_ple_layer.py`): NVFP4/FP8 dispatch for the PLE table;
  offloaded rows carry codes *and* scales (90 B/head); the GPU-side placeholder
  learns its quant method from config because its constructor is skipped under
  offload; tolerates multi-call `load_weights`; slices the 2560-wide IPC buffer
  to the 1440 valid bytes.
- **ModelOpt** (`patch_modelopt_mxfp8.py`): BF16 fallback for MXFP8 shapes that
  FlashInfer rejects. Also, unrelated to MXFP8: bridges NVIDIA checkpoints'
  MTP quantized_layers local-index declaration to the global index vLLM
  queries, and dispatches ModelOpt's `FP8_PB_WO` to vLLM's native block-scaled
  `Fp8MoEMethod` for `RoutedExperts` (no ModelOpt-native MoE method for it
  exists) — see [NVIDIA's official checkpoint](#nvidia-s-official-checkpoint-tp1_model_id) above.
- **PLE offload** (`patch_ple_offload.py`): GB10 has no CUDA stream memory ops
  (`CAN_USE_STREAM_MEM_OPS=0`, measured), and vLLM's offload semaphore used them
  and deadlocked after graph capture. Replaced with a host-side handshake — the
  GPU worker posts a request, the CPU worker copies and writes a sequence number
  to shared memory, the GPU worker proceeds. It also attaches the memory-mapped
  packed table instead of loading 27 GiB into RAM. The mmap is advised
  `MADV_RANDOM`: without it the kernel faults in a ~64 KiB window to serve each
  90-byte row lookup, and measurements here showed **24x** more disk read per
  decoded token (1,366 -> 57 KiB/token) plus ~2 GiB of page cache wasted on
  readahead that is never used.
- **FP8 KV cache** (`patch_qsa_fp8_kv.py`, via `KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8`): casts
  FP8 K/V tiles to BF16 for the tensor-core dots and applies the per-tensor
  scales once to the score and the normalised output, plumbs `k_scale`/
  `v_scale` into the kernels, and relaxes the four BF16-only guards and the
  inherited FlashAttention rejection. Avoiding an FP32 dequantisation tile lets
  FP8 keep the BF16 `block_n`. Raises the KV pool from ~800k to **1,132,586
  tokens** on the shipped profile (measured 2026-09-06; 1.43-1.50M at the
  pre-cap `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`), which is what makes a 1M context arithmetically
  possible on one Spark. **On by default** and still a real
  quality trade — see the warning `start.sh` prints.
  The FP8-KV approach is credited to
  [lancelind/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX](https://github.com/lancelind/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX)
  (Apache-2.0), reimplemented here against this image's own sources. That
  credit applies to this one patch; nothing else in this repository derives
  from that project.

### What the license does and does not cover

It covers the files in this repository — the launcher, the patch generators,
the packed-table builder and the watchdog. It does **not** relicense anything
they operate on, each of which carries its own terms:

- **vLLM** (Apache-2.0) — not redistributed here. `start.sh` extracts the
  pristine `*.orig` sources from the container image at runtime, and the patch
  generators emit modified copies onto your machine only. Those generated files
  keep vLLM's own Apache-2.0 headers and remain Apache-2.0 works.
- **The container image** `vllm/vllm-openai:qwen38-flash-next` and its
  dependencies — upstream terms apply.
- **The model checkpoint** `Mia-AiLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4` — weights are
  governed by the checkpoint's own license, not by this repository's.
- **The abliterated checkpoint**
  `drowzeys/keys-Qwen3.8-flash-next-ablit-Mia-Single-Spark-only`, served only
  when you opt in with `ABLIT=1` — gated on Hugging Face behind its own
  `RESPONSIBLE_USE.md` agreement, with its licence inherited from the upstream
  Qwen base model. This repository ships a flag that can serve those weights.
  It does not redistribute them and does not relicense them.
