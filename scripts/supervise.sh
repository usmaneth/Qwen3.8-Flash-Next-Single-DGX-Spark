# supervise.sh — the single state machine that owns the 24/7 lifecycle of the
# single-Spark vLLM container. Started as a systemd USER unit
# (qwen38-flash-supervisor.service, Restart=on-failure). The container itself
# runs with NO docker --restart (deliberately: docker restarting it behind our
# back resurrects it unwatched — memwatch dead, stale shm). The supervisor is
# the only actor that restarts.
#
# State lives in logs/supervisor.state (gitignored under logs/):
#   emergency_count, window_start, last_probe_fail, launch_failures.
# Restarting the supervisor must not forget the circuit breaker: heartbeats
# report unconditionally; guards do not reset on the guard's own restart.
#
# Ticks every 10 s:
#   1. Boot gate: docker info must succeed (user unit cannot order after
#      docker.service; poll instead). No alert storm while docker is down.
#   2. comfy-h3.service (user + system scope) active -> do nothing, alert at
#      most once/hour (port thief, review §4.7).
#   3. Container missing -> if a stopping flag is up (flag file logs/stopping;
#      a "manual" first line = a human's stop.sh: held forever, never
#      reclaimed, resumed by start.sh / maintenance-relaunch.sh or reboot;
#      anything else = a maintenance window, reclaimed loudly after
#      STOPPING_MAX_AGE_S) wait; else clean_shm -> start.sh -> on non-zero
#      exit backoff 30s*2^n cap 15min charged to FAILED attempts only
#      (first attempt is immediate), count launch_failures; reset only after
#      a launch reaches /health 200. Each attempt writes its own
#      logs/supervise-start-<ts>.log (supervise-start.log symlinks the
#      newest) so a failed attempt's evidence survives the next one.
#   4. Container up but memwatch not running -> start it via the shared
#      scripts/start-memwatch.sh (same invocation start.sh uses).
#   5. Probe cadence 1/min: 5 consecutive failures -> emergency: alert ->
#      stop.sh -> emergency_count++ -> step 3.
#   6. Circuit breaker: 3 emergencies in a 2h rolling window -> BREAKER_OPEN in
#      state; while open, only alert every 30 min, never relaunch. Human
#      re-arms by removing the state file; BREAKER_RESET_ON_BOOT=1 clears it
#      on reboot (a reboot is a human's hand on the box).
