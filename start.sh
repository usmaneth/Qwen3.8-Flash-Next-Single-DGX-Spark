# tp1/start.sh — Single-node, single-GPU (TP=1) vLLM launch on ONE DGX Spark.
#
# Serves the Mia-AiLab NVFP4 checkpoint — MXFP8 attention + a 4-bit NVFP4 PLE
# table. ABLIT=1 in .env switches to the gated Keys checkpoint
# (drowzeys/keys-Qwen3.8-flash-next-ablit-Mia-Single-Spark-only): same Mia
# 34-shard layout, QSA self_attn.o_proj replaced at L15/19/23/27/31/35/39/43/47.
# That repo is gated — accept the Hugging Face terms, then ABLIT=1 ./download.sh.
# The memory figures below were measured on the equivalent
# local-inference-lab build (98.6 GiB on disk); re-check them if this
# checkpoint's on-disk size differs. The RadixArk build (125.9 GiB) cannot fit
# one Spark and is not offered here.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW IT FITS (measured on this box — see docs/HANDOFF-single-spark.md)
#
#   unified pool ............ 121.69 GiB   (LPDDR5X; CPU and GPU share it)
#   checkpoint on disk ......  98.57 GiB
#     of which PLE table ....  26.82 GiB   -> NOT on the GPU (see below)
#   weights on GPU ..........  71.75 GiB
#   runtime overhead ........   5.6  GiB   (non-torch 3.37 + activation 1.92
#                                          + graphs 0.12, all measured at TP1)
#   KV cache ................  what the host-side cap leaves (~16 GiB at the
#                                default HOST_RESERVE_GIB=26; FP8 => ~1M tok)
#
# The PLE n-gram table is served by vLLM's CPU-offload worker from a
# MEMORY-MAPPED pre-packed file (files/build_ple_packed_table.py, built on
# first launch, ~40 s). File-backed pages are evictable page cache, so the
# non-evictable footprint of the whole deployment is ~78 GiB + KV instead of
# ~104 GiB + KV. That margin is what keeps the host alive: exhausting the
# unified pool hangs the kernel (no OOM, no logs — three times last session).
#
# Two GB10-specific bugs in vLLM's offload path are patched in
# files/patch_ple_offload.py (CUDA stream memory ops are unsupported on GB10,
# which deadlocked the GPU worker after graph capture) and
# files/patch_ple_layer.py (offload rows must carry codes AND scales).
#
# SAFETY (no sudo needed):
#   * The GPU budget is capped FROM THE HOST SIDE: GMU x MemTotal never exceeds
#     MemTotal - HOST_RESERVE_GIB (default 26). vLLM treats this integrated
#     GPU's "free memory" as MemAvailable (page cache included) and fills the
#     GPU side to exactly the budget, so a KV_TARGET_GIB wish that is not
#     capped comes straight out of the PLE page cache and the free pages the
#     NVIDIA driver needs. That is what killed three servers on 2026-09-04
#     (docs/memory-incident-2026-09-04.md section 7). The reserve covers, in
#     order: other containers and sessions (~7 GiB measured here), vLLM's own
#     host-side processes (~6), PLE page cache (>=6), the driver's free-page
#     reserve (>=3), and 2-3 GiB of per-request growth that is never returned.
#   * The container runs under a hard cgroup memory cap. Measured: GPU
#     parameter allocations are NOT charged to it on GB10, so the cap bounds
#     the host-side footprint (Python procs, pinned buffers, page cache) while
#     vLLM's own --gpu-memory-utilization budget bounds the GPU side. It does
#     not protect the host from the GPU side; HOST_RESERVE_GIB does.
#   * A background watchdog (files/memwatch.sh) stops the container if host
#     MemAvailable stays below MEMWATCH_MIN_GIB or MemFree stays below
#     MEMWATCH_MIN_FREE_GIB, archiving the container log first.
#   * comfy-h3.service is a bash loop that launches ComfyUI (a GPU co-tenant)
#     the moment *anything* answers on port 8888. The launcher refuses 8888
#     while that service is active (disable it: sudo systemctl disable --now
#     comfy-h3.service); with it disabled the default port is 8888.
#
# Context above the native 262144 needs YaRN. MAX_MODEL_LEN is the YARN=0
# length; YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN (default 524288) is served instead when YARN=1.
# Both live in .env, so the 0/1 flag alone switches between them. 1M does not fit.
# ABLIT=0/1 likewise switches the checkpoint: 0 is stock Mia NVFP4, 1 is the
# gated Keys ablit snapshot (accept Hugging Face terms, then ./download.sh).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Usage:
#   ./start.sh                  # profile from .env (262k, MTP 3, port 8888)
#   ./start.sh --no-launch      # patch + print the command, don't start
#   MAX_MODEL_LEN=262144 ./start.sh
#   MTP_NUM_SPECULATIVE_TOKENS=3 ./start.sh   # re-enable MTP (1.5 GiB)
#   YARN=1 ./start.sh                         # YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN (512k) via YaRN
#   ABLIT=1 ./start.sh                        # gated ablit checkpoint (download first)
#   GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.75 ./start.sh    # pin the budget yourself
#   HOST_RESERVE_GIB=28 ./start.sh            # more host margin, less KV
